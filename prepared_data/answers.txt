<BOS> That's right. <EOS>
<BOS> I was born in Montreal and I lived there for four years, the first four years but uh, I grew up in Calgary, which is Alberta, in the city of Banff. <EOS>
<BOS> Childhood I was into books. I was a big reader. I used to go the the library with my mother. And the first big trip I took overseas was when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> On this trip I went to Liverpool which is where my mother is from. So I went to Liverpool that time and Wales and Scotland and five or six trips after that. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could sing, but no, I don't sing.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just not ballroom dancing, but just the ordinary one, you know, the just kind of just normal...nothing special.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to cook vegetables, yeah. Vegetables! OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Very much so I go, I used to go to the gym three times a week before I arrived in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like a clean place, but I don't really like to clean, no! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> I live in quite a big house. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> About 12. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 80 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not very old for England. <EOS>
<BOS> A big round table and a cooker. <EOS>
<BOS> A TV and a video. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Anything. I don't really like watching sport. <EOS>
<BOS> Some sports are OK. I don't like watching golf, snooker, and sports like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a lot people think the summers in Norway are really cold, but actually they're not. Maybe everything, the weather is changing because of El Nino effect, I don't know, but we've had, for the last four or five years, we've had pretty warm summers. It gets close to 30 degrees centigrade, and which is enjoyable I guess, and there's no humidity. It's nice and dry and it's just pleasant weather really. Yeah, and what we do in the summers is different. Some people have a house on small islands on the coast, or some people have a house on the mountains, and you can either go to the mountains and enjoy the lakes, the forests, or you can go to the coast and enjoy the beach, the water, go fishing, so there's plenty of things to do in the summer, yeah, and we get a lot of tourist coming in the summer though, because it's not that hot. It's just pleasant and enjoyable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it is. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like American food.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like hamburgers.  <EOS>
<BOS> That is my favorite dish. My favorite hamburger place is right near where I went to university and they have this hamburger called the Danish Burger, and the Danish Burger has blue cheese inside the hamburger, so I love ... my favorite dish has to be the Danish Burger. <EOS>
<BOS> I love french fries but I know that eating hamburger and french fries is a little bit unhealthy so I always replace the french fries for a salad. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite dessert has to be chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and choc ... brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don't like raw onions. <EOS>
<BOS> I really can't eat onions raw. That's probably the only vegetable I can't eat raw. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, um, I wanna be a physician's assistant.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, normally when you go into a, into the doctor's office, you wouldn't usually get, well you would get your doctor all they do is check, give you check-ups or you know maybe take out stitches or something, not surgery. You just go in and do the little things. So the doctor does not have to do them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Nothing wrong with that.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lot of schooling. You have like six years, four or six years of college and you obviously take the,like nursing and other kinds of classes like that and then you do like um, two, two or four years at like a hospital as a.. <EOS>
<BOS> Like, like you're actually doing. <EOS>
<BOS> An intern, yeah! An internship for two or four years at a hospital.  <EOS>
<BOS> And then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor's place and open that up or something. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you.  <EOS>
<BOS> Playing soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! <EOS>
<BOS> Now I don't play, but before I played about three or four times a week. <EOS>
<BOS> I've retired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I came to Japan. I had a soccer team, but now that I work in Japan I can't play for my soccer team at home. <EOS>
<BOS> These days? No! No time. Always working at Seitoku. <EOS>
<BOS> That's hard to say. Right now, there's a kid named Ronaldino for Brazil. Maybe he will be the best.  <EOS>
<BOS> Deep Cove Royals. That's my soccer team. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to cook? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you put on your barbecue? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you not like to dance? <EOS>
<BOS> At all? <EOS>
<BOS> So you don't dance at all? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to sing? <EOS>
<BOS> Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> How were you not a good student growing up? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete? <EOS>
<BOS> What sports did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one is your best sport? <EOS>
<BOS> How long did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's warm, and blue skies, and fluffy white clouds. <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. It was a lot of fun. It's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I tried a couple of times but I didn't want to learn in the summer time cause the beaches are too crowded so I tried in the winter but the water is very cold so I gave up after a couple of tries. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the Pacific's cold. <EOS>
<BOS> 10,000,000. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, first thing I'd do, I'd probably buy a nice house for me and my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I don't know. We'll have to talk about that with the wife but probably somewhere near Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, a little further out of the middle of Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, in Japan, but some place not too crowded. <EOS>
<BOS> Not if I could help it. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, maybe a dog, but an outside dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. <EOS>
<BOS> I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I got it when I was 17 actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I think it's changed since I was a teenager. At that time, you get a learner's permit. And then you start driving with your parents. And you'd also go to drivers ed. And then you had to pass a driving test. I think a written test as well.  <EOS>
<BOS> I was close to perfect, yeah. I can't remember my exact score but I remember it was pretty good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. Lots of fun. Lots of friends. Learned quite a bit at school. <EOS>
<BOS> I studied mainly sciences actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Biology. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Oh, No! I didn't. I went on to do a bachelor of technology. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of similar. Related. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I did rowing for the school. I played basketball, played tennis, was on the swimming team. <EOS>
<BOS> Rowing. <EOS>
<BOS> No, unfortunately not. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, maybe, if I'm around a lake or a river. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, lots of parties. It was good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, sure. <EOS>
<BOS> According to my view, Mr. Sachin Tendulkar is the best player. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he's from India. <EOS>
<BOS> He's north India. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, batsman. <EOS>
<BOS> How many times you bat? <EOS>
<BOS> Until you are out you can bat. Until you are out you can bat. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not like that. Until you get out you can play. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes, I used to play cricket with my friends. <EOS>
<BOS> Sachin Tendulkar. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, sorry, I don't know anything about baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> How long is a typical class? Do you have, let's say, six classes a day, each class is one hour?  <EOS>
<BOS> And then, what do you do in the afternoon?  <EOS>
<BOS> You go home? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so you split the school? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so the children have to do all that work? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, Hawaii is my home, but to people not from Hawaii, I think Hawaii is famous for its nice weather, its warm all year round, also it's known for its beaches. The beaches are very nice. And it's also known for its warm hospitality. The people are also very nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> It does rain, but often it rains and it's sunny at the same time, so we have a lot of rainbows. Hawaii is also famous for rainbows.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have beaches on all shores of the island -- all our islands. There's many beaches to choose from. And often, some beaches have big waves, some beaches have small waves, and you can choose which beach to go to depending on whether you want to surf in big waves or you want to swim where there's no waves. <EOS>
<BOS> We have forests, so there's lots of animals, like birds, and small animals like wallabies <EOS>
<BOS> Wallabies, they're those little mammals from Australia and they were introduced in Hawaii and now they're wild in Hawaii. They've become their own species.  <EOS>
<BOS> They look like little kangaroos I think.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have a lot of pigs, wild pigs. We like to go hunting for them and we like to eat them.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have nice coral reefs, so there's lots of beautiful fish in our coral reefs and many people like to go snorkeling to look at our reefs. We also have turtles and seals in Hawaii.  <EOS>
<BOS> We do have whales during the months of March till February I believe. They come from Alaska and they come to Hawaii during those months and then they return to Alaska.  <EOS>
<BOS> Why just the news? <EOS>
<BOS> And that's it. Nothing else? <EOS>
<BOS> Usually? <EOS>
<BOS> But that's it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of movies do you like? <EOS>
<BOS> Comedies. What's the most recent movie you watched? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you read books? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of books do you read for school? <EOS>
<BOS> If you have to read. So nothing? No books for pleasure? <EOS>
<BOS> So when you're on the airplane, you don't read? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you go to concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you go see, or what type of concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> So music concerts. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, Ron, thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's right. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I read a lot. In fact I don't have a television. <EOS>
<BOS> Seriously, I only read. <EOS>
<BOS> A week! Ah, at least one a week, because I work all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I enjoy reading because television doesn't give you imagination, yeah I prefer reading. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, let's see, I've got a lot of nonfiction, a lot of comedy. <EOS>
<BOS> Where do I normally read? On the trains, actually. I'm always reading on the trains. I read because I'm always traveling to work. A lot of pleasure. And it's funny because I meet people on the trains when I'm reading, they look over at my book. <EOS>
<BOS> My dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country, preferably in Japan. That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end. <EOS>
<BOS> No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went through that stage, you know. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright, fair enough. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's good. <EOS>
<BOS> What exactly is Hawaiian food? <EOS>
<BOS> So then what's your favorite Hawaiian dish? <EOS>
<BOS> So the flavor is just salt? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite dessert or junk food? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite ice-cream flavor? <EOS>
<BOS> Mm, sounds good. Do you like vegetables? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite vegetable? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you eat your vegetables raw ... like salad ... or do you prefer them cooked? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Ron. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I get home from work, I like to relax, have a drink and watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> About 7 <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I take the train. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm usually about midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm pretty tired by then. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 <EOS>
<BOS> That's all I need. <EOS>
<BOS> Not so often but sometimes I can see them when I'm walking home. And sometimes the moon! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> At the moment, yeah, but it is getting warmer, summer is approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a morning person. <EOS>
<BOS> If I have a good reason, but usually I get tired after midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> See you later! <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook Manicotti, Tacos, lots of food. <EOS>
<BOS> Manicotti is...it's a big noodle. It's hollow on the inside and you fill it with different cheeses and then you put red tomato sauce over the top of it and..it's pretty good <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you use Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, um , Parmesan Cheese,a little bit of salt, and basil and stuff and you mix it all together in a pot and then you stuff it in the noodle, and you put the noodle in the pan and shove it in the oven for 35 minutes and let it cook.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, a couple times a month, probably.  <EOS>
<BOS> You got to make it tasty, cause if you add enough salt or Parmesan cheese then it doesn't taste as good.It just tastes like your eating cheese. That's it.  <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome.  <EOS>
<BOS> Okay, now in your city, what is one food I should definitely try?  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. khuushuur?  <EOS>
<BOS> So it's like a dumpling and inside it's meat.  <EOS>
<BOS> Like a flour-based...  <EOS>
<BOS> So people mainly eat beef.  <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything I should buy? Like, what would be a good souvenir or gift from your country?  <EOS>
<BOS> A little tent? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, like a little doll house?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do! <EOS>
<BOS> I kind of alternate between fiction and non-fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm reading two books now. The Ethics of Startrek, which my uncle gave me, which is non-fiction, and I just started it today <EOS>
<BOS> Right now I've just started, so it's about a women who has been having an affair, basically. <EOS>
<BOS> I read on the trains while I'm commuting to work. I read at night, on the weekends.  <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite author. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite season is spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's not so cold but it's not so hot that I'm sweating on the train. I can go to the beach. I can relax with my friends outside. It's very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> My least favorite season in Japan is the rainy season ...because I don't like rain at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now it is the very end of winter. It is just starting to become spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Today, it's very sunny. It's a little cool. A little breezy. It's very nice. I enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have two cameras. I have a digital camera and a SLR camera. <EOS>
<BOS> Recently I am using the digital camera a lot. I can make the photos on my personal computer. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to take photos of people, mainly, sometimes landscapes but mainly people. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, family and friends, sometimes strangers. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like it! No, I'm not shy. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes, or I might make a silly face. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to look at nice landscapes, and cityscapes. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I've got a couple at home, but they're a bit embarassing. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I've got a picture of my mum and dad. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello! <EOS>
<BOS> Sophie Wilkins. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Adelaide, South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a big country town, although it is actually a capital city of South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 1.8 million people. <EOS>
<BOS> I've lived there for about six years. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I was actually born on a farm in mid-north South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> I love it. I love the space, how clean it is, the health, the lifestyle. It's very healthy, and the people as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Temporarily I think yes. For a couple of months and then hopefully come back to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright.  <EOS>
<BOS> This is the Rock Castle. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it? <EOS>
<BOS> What else should people you see? <EOS>
<BOS> Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again? <EOS>
<BOS> The Temple of Tooth Relic. <EOS>
<BOS> Kandy. OK. Well, thanks for the tips Mini. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, in Japan mostly the radio or the internet. <EOS>
<BOS> NPR, but on the military station. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public. <EOS>
<BOS> I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing. <EOS>
<BOS> I am really excited. This summer I'm going to my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. We are having a huge party and I'm really excited. My entire family is going to be there. they're renting a house in Lake Tahoe, which is where my mom grew up, and where my grandparents spent the majority of their life together. We'll be there for a week, on the lake, boating, jet skiing, that whole thing, and then this Saturday we're having a party with people I've never even met. Everyone's gonna be there. I'm really excited. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, gosh, I have no idea. Every time I speak to my mother I hear somebody knew who has been invited and somebody else is going to be there. I'm really excited. It's going to be a lot of fun. My grandparents are crazy. They actually got engaged a month after they met, and February, the shortest month of the year. My grandfather told my grandmother he loved her a week after they met, and then he proposed and then he was in service so he went away until August. They didn't see each other until they got married. Yeah, my grandmother says, "If any of you kids do this, we'll kill you. I can't believe 50 years later they're still together.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to eat whole grain bread or bagels or something that's dark.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite thing to put on bread is tomatoes and I also like honey. <EOS>
<BOS> Not together, no. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like mustard. <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I know people that eat mustard sandwiches, and no! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. Actually, I'm a baker. <EOS>
<BOS> Although, bread is kind of a different branch. I do cakes and stuff like that. I can make bread. My grandmother makes bread all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> OK  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook a little bit. I like cooking. <EOS>
<BOS> Just simple things. I love salad. I make a huge salad. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I can't sing. I just sing for me. On the...when I have a shower. <EOS>
<BOS> No, mainly reaggae. I love reggae. <EOS>
<BOS> Dijuridu!  <EOS>
<BOS> It's an Australian instrument. <EOS>
<BOS> I learned in Switzerland. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's popular. Everybody knows about it. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of years maybe. Maybe 4 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello!  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is Nanju. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is like N-A-N-J-U. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Madras.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's in the South India. <EOS>
<BOS> South India. <EOS>
<BOS> The past four months I am here and working in somewhere, working. <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal, a software engineer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, nothing. Just I know how to program and that's it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I might be, from the 12th standard. like 18th years. From 18 years I am working with the computer. <EOS>
<BOS> My first proper boyfriend was probably when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> His name was Murray. <EOS>
<BOS> He went to a different school, he went to a school near my school. <EOS>
<BOS> We met through mutual friends. His friend knew my friend.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, we did.  <EOS>
<BOS> We went to the cinema. We used to go and listen to music, watch bands, and we used to go to like the fair, and things like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. They really liked him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We went out a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> Two and a half years, nearly three years. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, 17. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, he's living in my flat at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we're like really good friends. <EOS>
<BOS> He's renting my flat off of me. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. So-so. <EOS>
<BOS> Once a week, I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> In Japan, it depends on the season. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say maybe about a 100..15..450 yen per an apple. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Aomori Prefecture. <EOS>
<BOS> Which is in the northern part of Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Red or green or yellow. <EOS>
<BOS> Red. <EOS>
<BOS> Really! Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Does it taste different than the red apples? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. <EOS>
<BOS> Apple Juice, apple pie, and apple tea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I watch the news in the morning and when I come home at night I sometimes watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite TV show. <EOS>
<BOS> I really like going to the movies. I think I go maybe once a month or maybe once every two months. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't rent movies but sometimes I download movies. I like to watch comedies - romantic comedies - and a little bit of drama. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie... I don't know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called "27 Dresses". It is about a girl, or a woman, who is a bridesmaid twenty-seven times. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. <EOS>
<BOS> I do like to read books. Right now, I'm really busy with work so I don't have a lot of time to read but when I'm on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to read non-fiction usually. Biographies of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't go to music concerts. I don't think I've ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say my favorite music would have to be the Beatles. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, so we have all these old 45's when I was younger and this record player, and so we had loads of like Simon and Garfunkel and the Beatles and the Stones so that was the music I grew up listening to, and that's what I still really love. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, probably it's "Happiness is a warm gun" which is on the White Album. <EOS>
<BOS> I love all their albums. But I haven't been to Liverpool yet. I'd like to go. That would be nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> John Lennon, definitely. He's definitely the coolest. I like his songs. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> The earth is big.  <EOS>
<BOS> I'm small on the earth. <EOS>
<BOS> I weigh 65. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> A big house is expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> What is cheap? The 100 Yen shop is cheap. <EOS>
<BOS> About everything. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like the 100 Yen shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. No problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I say, green. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite fruit <EOS>
<BOS> I've had a couple. Much better than the ones I have back in Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say spring, cause it's a combination of warm weather, at the same time it's not hot like it is in the summer. In spring it's a bit cool. You can walk around very relaxed. It the best. It's a combination of all the seasons in one.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie! I'd have to say "Gladiator." Russel Crow. It's a tragic movie about a very strong leader who, how-should-I-say, triumphs over, how-should-I-say, over very overpowering conflicts. It's, um, plus, I'm a bit of an action movie buff. I know it's sad to hear but, it's definitely an interesting movie.  <EOS>
<BOS> Hey! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm OK. How are you? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like summer it's my least favorite summer. <EOS>
<BOS> Because I don't like hot weather. I don't like being hot and sweaty and uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's pretty hot but usually we go away on the weekends to cottages and we go swimming in lakes and stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> Winter or fall. <EOS>
<BOS> In the winter, activities you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite color, black. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruit? OK, it's mango. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I haven't seen a proper mango here, because everything's very small, that is not a very good mango, I know because in India I will get a lot of mangoes, very good taste, and variety of mangoes, I haven't tried, I haven't found anywhere in Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'll eat it raw. The raw mango is very good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. But mango juice, it's not that much good. I eat only raw mango. It will be very good, very good, very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm realy tired. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of, I don't know, my throat's really scratchy, so maybe I'm coming down with something. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I am. I had a private student last night and she told me some wild formula to do. And she asked me to take coca-cola, boil it, add some ginger, and then drink it, however, I'm caffiene sensitive so it kept me up pretty much all night, so I'm really tired today.  <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't bad. If it was probably mid-afternoon, I would love it, but 11 <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No I think I'm just going to stick with the regular cold syrup, and just take that. <EOS>
<BOS> It does. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! <EOS>
<BOS> I play in a Swedish Bubblegum Punk Band. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know, but that's what it says on the CD. <EOS>
<BOS> I play bass guitar. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been playing the guitar for about 12 or 13 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I play a little guitar and a little drums. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> We just play in clubs. Local clubs. <EOS>
<BOS> It's really good for relaxing and having fun. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not. It's only a hobby. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> No, if I am getting opportunity I will be very happy. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's a lot of cobras. I have seen a lot of cobras, and fighting with cobras, each other, but run away so I can not. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have seen a lot of cobras, which is going to be 12 feet. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I will get some sticks and go through about from my home or something. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I won't kill it. Killing of cobra is very illegal in India. Not illegal, it's like god, so we won't. <EOS>
<BOS> So we won't kill that cobra or something. <EOS>
<BOS> My name is Mathew Gill. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from England, from North of England, near Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I was living in Bangkok, in Thailand, before I came to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, something like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Manchester's well know for being quite a grim, industrial town. but it's got a more modern reputation as a center of arts, and there's lots of cool music that comes out of there. Oasis from Manchester is the most famous band, and the Smiths, kind of fifteen years ago, came from Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's a fantastic place, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right, yeah, I'm not Yakuza though, so don't worry. <EOS>
<BOS> I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal. <EOS>
<BOS> I drew the tattoo, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt. <EOS>
<BOS> Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright <EOS>
<BOS> I want to go to Thailand. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I love that country. The people, the food and the culture. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I guess from Narita Airport. <EOS>
<BOS> Approximately 7 hours I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> I would eat Thai food which is something like Pat Thai, which is a Thai noodle, or Tom Yang Gung, which is a Thai soup. <EOS>
<BOS> It's spicy.  <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I can. <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I don't get fired. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> The beach. It's cold here. It's getting warm but I like warm weather. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, another beach person. <EOS>
<BOS> I love the beach. The beach is great. <EOS>
<BOS> It's nice fresh air, beautiful water, you can play in the sand, and my hobby is surfing, so I like to go surfing. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to go as often as possible, usually every weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Usually early on a Saturday morning. Try to beat the crowds. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just relax on the sand, watch the people, maybe have a swim, throw a frisbee. <EOS>
<BOS> Since I was ten years old. <EOS>
<BOS> A towel, and my hat, my sunscreen, my surfboard, wetsuit, some food and water, and maybe a radio. <EOS>
<BOS> The beaches are much bigger and white sand, clean water, very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Catch you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yep. <EOS>
<BOS> It's, I'm working for Tsukigi Fish Market, which is quite big and it's of course the two place, which is inside and outside. I work for outside.  <EOS>
<BOS> Normally sell the fish. It's the main job. But I also have to carry fish,  and you know, um carrying ice and put, put ice, um, yeah, and preserve fish. <EOS>
<BOS> 5 <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> About 4 <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's no good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Baking. What do you like to bake? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds very good. I would like to eat one of your brownies. OK, next, are you a good singer? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. OK, next. Are you a good dancer? <EOS>
<BOS> So, you're a teacher now right? So, were you a good student when you were a student? <EOS>
<BOS> And athletics? Were you a good athlete, and are you a good athlete now? <EOS>
<BOS> And which one was your favorite sport? <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to mail this package to Italy. <EOS>
<BOS> Some toys and baby clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> I have it here. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. When will my package arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> I would like your fastest shipping. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> With my credit card. <EOS>
<BOS> No. That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> You too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> My son was in an auto accident last night. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago. <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Alice. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Transmission problems can be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you afford a new car? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car. <EOS>
<BOS> This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice to hear. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a toothache. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! 4 pm is perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ok. I will be there at 3 <EOS>
<BOS> Bye. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join me? <EOS>
<BOS> ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market. <EOS>
<BOS> You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you have any? <EOS>
<BOS> They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I can wait for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work. <EOS>
<BOS> I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am. I work out for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, how about lifting weights? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about aerobics? <EOS>
<BOS> Yoga? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market. <EOS>
<BOS> The one down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I always go to that market. <EOS>
<BOS> It's always so crowded there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I still like the smaller store. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been waiting? <EOS>
<BOS> That's 30 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> There are still several people ahead of us. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later. <EOS>
<BOS> Bye Kevin. <EOS>
<BOS> There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I hope no one was seriously injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I didn't see it happen. <EOS>
<BOS> After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving. <EOS>
<BOS> We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Peter. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Does your younger son loan him money? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny and smart. He's like a bank. <EOS>
<BOS> This is giving him great experience. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but the line is usually very long. <EOS>
<BOS> Overseas to Korea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think the line will be long today? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go have lunch instead? <EOS>
<BOS> Why Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to go. <EOS>
<BOS> But it hurt last time. <EOS>
<BOS> But I brush my teeth every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I don't have any cavities this time. <EOS>
<BOS> What time are you picking me up? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll tell my teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work. <EOS>
<BOS> Three? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. What about riding your bike to work? <EOS>
<BOS> You can carpool with someone. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work with anyone who lives near you? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you want to ride with your boss? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal to be nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to get him a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Did your auto insurance go up a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> When will that be? <EOS>
<BOS> Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of procedure? <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That should help. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's important to have dental insurance. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. <EOS>
<BOS> To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They are all overdue. <EOS>
<BOS> We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room. <EOS>
<BOS> About two months. <EOS>
<BOS> I found the notices in his room too. <EOS>
<BOS> He said he couldn't find them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is. <EOS>
<BOS> Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm learning that now. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> The mechanic is my brother-in-law. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car? <EOS>
<BOS> At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper. <EOS>
<BOS> It's supposed to be ready this afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent. <EOS>
<BOS> They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a few minutes before they close. <EOS>
<BOS> They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school? <EOS>
<BOS> I like pretzels and potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I go to the market with you? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to take break. I've been studying all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we get ice cream on the way home? <EOS>
<BOS> I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test. <EOS>
