<BOS> That's right. <EOS>
<BOS> I was born in Montreal and I lived there for four years, the first four years but uh, I grew up in Calgary, which is Alberta, in the city of Banff. <EOS>
<BOS> Childhood I was into books. I was a big reader. I used to go the the library with my mother. And the first big trip I took overseas was when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> On this trip I went to Liverpool which is where my mother is from. So I went to Liverpool that time and Wales and Scotland and five or six trips after that. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could sing, but no, I don't sing.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just not ballroom dancing, but just the ordinary one, you know, the just kind of just normal...nothing special.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to cook vegetables, yeah. Vegetables! OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Very much so I go, I used to go to the gym three times a week before I arrived in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like a clean place, but I don't really like to clean, no! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> I live in quite a big house. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> About 12. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 80 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not very old for England. <EOS>
<BOS> A big round table and a cooker. <EOS>
<BOS> A TV and a video. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Anything. I don't really like watching sport. <EOS>
<BOS> Some sports are OK. I don't like watching golf, snooker, and sports like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a lot people think the summers in Norway are really cold, but actually they're not. Maybe everything, the weather is changing because of El Nino effect, I don't know, but we've had, for the last four or five years, we've had pretty warm summers. It gets close to 30 degrees centigrade, and which is enjoyable I guess, and there's no humidity. It's nice and dry and it's just pleasant weather really. Yeah, and what we do in the summers is different. Some people have a house on small islands on the coast, or some people have a house on the mountains, and you can either go to the mountains and enjoy the lakes, the forests, or you can go to the coast and enjoy the beach, the water, go fishing, so there's plenty of things to do in the summer, yeah, and we get a lot of tourist coming in the summer though, because it's not that hot. It's just pleasant and enjoyable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it is. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like American food.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like hamburgers.  <EOS>
<BOS> That is my favorite dish. My favorite hamburger place is right near where I went to university and they have this hamburger called the Danish Burger, and the Danish Burger has blue cheese inside the hamburger, so I love ... my favorite dish has to be the Danish Burger. <EOS>
<BOS> I love french fries but I know that eating hamburger and french fries is a little bit unhealthy so I always replace the french fries for a salad. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite dessert has to be chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and choc ... brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don't like raw onions. <EOS>
<BOS> I really can't eat onions raw. That's probably the only vegetable I can't eat raw. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, um, I wanna be a physician's assistant.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, normally when you go into a, into the doctor's office, you wouldn't usually get, well you would get your doctor all they do is check, give you check-ups or you know maybe take out stitches or something, not surgery. You just go in and do the little things. So the doctor does not have to do them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Nothing wrong with that.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lot of schooling. You have like six years, four or six years of college and you obviously take the,like nursing and other kinds of classes like that and then you do like um, two, two or four years at like a hospital as a.. <EOS>
<BOS> Like, like you're actually doing. <EOS>
<BOS> An intern, yeah! An internship for two or four years at a hospital.  <EOS>
<BOS> And then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor's place and open that up or something. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you.  <EOS>
<BOS> Playing soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! <EOS>
<BOS> Now I don't play, but before I played about three or four times a week. <EOS>
<BOS> I've retired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I came to Japan. I had a soccer team, but now that I work in Japan I can't play for my soccer team at home. <EOS>
<BOS> These days? No! No time. Always working at Seitoku. <EOS>
<BOS> That's hard to say. Right now, there's a kid named Ronaldino for Brazil. Maybe he will be the best.  <EOS>
<BOS> Deep Cove Royals. That's my soccer team. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to cook? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you put on your barbecue? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you not like to dance? <EOS>
<BOS> At all? <EOS>
<BOS> So you don't dance at all? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to sing? <EOS>
<BOS> Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> How were you not a good student growing up? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete? <EOS>
<BOS> What sports did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one is your best sport? <EOS>
<BOS> How long did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's warm, and blue skies, and fluffy white clouds. <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. It was a lot of fun. It's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I tried a couple of times but I didn't want to learn in the summer time cause the beaches are too crowded so I tried in the winter but the water is very cold so I gave up after a couple of tries. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the Pacific's cold. <EOS>
<BOS> 10,000,000. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, first thing I'd do, I'd probably buy a nice house for me and my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I don't know. We'll have to talk about that with the wife but probably somewhere near Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, a little further out of the middle of Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, in Japan, but some place not too crowded. <EOS>
<BOS> Not if I could help it. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, maybe a dog, but an outside dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. <EOS>
<BOS> I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I got it when I was 17 actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I think it's changed since I was a teenager. At that time, you get a learner's permit. And then you start driving with your parents. And you'd also go to drivers ed. And then you had to pass a driving test. I think a written test as well.  <EOS>
<BOS> I was close to perfect, yeah. I can't remember my exact score but I remember it was pretty good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. Lots of fun. Lots of friends. Learned quite a bit at school. <EOS>
<BOS> I studied mainly sciences actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Biology. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Oh, No! I didn't. I went on to do a bachelor of technology. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of similar. Related. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I did rowing for the school. I played basketball, played tennis, was on the swimming team. <EOS>
<BOS> Rowing. <EOS>
<BOS> No, unfortunately not. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, maybe, if I'm around a lake or a river. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, lots of parties. It was good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, sure. <EOS>
<BOS> According to my view, Mr. Sachin Tendulkar is the best player. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he's from India. <EOS>
<BOS> He's north India. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, batsman. <EOS>
<BOS> How many times you bat? <EOS>
<BOS> Until you are out you can bat. Until you are out you can bat. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not like that. Until you get out you can play. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes, I used to play cricket with my friends. <EOS>
<BOS> Sachin Tendulkar. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, sorry, I don't know anything about baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> How long is a typical class? Do you have, let's say, six classes a day, each class is one hour?  <EOS>
<BOS> And then, what do you do in the afternoon?  <EOS>
<BOS> You go home? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so you split the school? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so the children have to do all that work? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, Hawaii is my home, but to people not from Hawaii, I think Hawaii is famous for its nice weather, its warm all year round, also it's known for its beaches. The beaches are very nice. And it's also known for its warm hospitality. The people are also very nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> It does rain, but often it rains and it's sunny at the same time, so we have a lot of rainbows. Hawaii is also famous for rainbows.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have beaches on all shores of the island -- all our islands. There's many beaches to choose from. And often, some beaches have big waves, some beaches have small waves, and you can choose which beach to go to depending on whether you want to surf in big waves or you want to swim where there's no waves. <EOS>
<BOS> We have forests, so there's lots of animals, like birds, and small animals like wallabies <EOS>
<BOS> Wallabies, they're those little mammals from Australia and they were introduced in Hawaii and now they're wild in Hawaii. They've become their own species.  <EOS>
<BOS> They look like little kangaroos I think.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have a lot of pigs, wild pigs. We like to go hunting for them and we like to eat them.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have nice coral reefs, so there's lots of beautiful fish in our coral reefs and many people like to go snorkeling to look at our reefs. We also have turtles and seals in Hawaii.  <EOS>
<BOS> We do have whales during the months of March till February I believe. They come from Alaska and they come to Hawaii during those months and then they return to Alaska.  <EOS>
<BOS> Why just the news? <EOS>
<BOS> And that's it. Nothing else? <EOS>
<BOS> Usually? <EOS>
<BOS> But that's it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of movies do you like? <EOS>
<BOS> Comedies. What's the most recent movie you watched? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you read books? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of books do you read for school? <EOS>
<BOS> If you have to read. So nothing? No books for pleasure? <EOS>
<BOS> So when you're on the airplane, you don't read? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you go to concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you go see, or what type of concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> So music concerts. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, Ron, thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's right. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I read a lot. In fact I don't have a television. <EOS>
<BOS> Seriously, I only read. <EOS>
<BOS> A week! Ah, at least one a week, because I work all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I enjoy reading because television doesn't give you imagination, yeah I prefer reading. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, let's see, I've got a lot of nonfiction, a lot of comedy. <EOS>
<BOS> Where do I normally read? On the trains, actually. I'm always reading on the trains. I read because I'm always traveling to work. A lot of pleasure. And it's funny because I meet people on the trains when I'm reading, they look over at my book. <EOS>
<BOS> My dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country, preferably in Japan. That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end. <EOS>
<BOS> No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went through that stage, you know. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright, fair enough. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's good. <EOS>
<BOS> What exactly is Hawaiian food? <EOS>
<BOS> So then what's your favorite Hawaiian dish? <EOS>
<BOS> So the flavor is just salt? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite dessert or junk food? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite ice-cream flavor? <EOS>
<BOS> Mm, sounds good. Do you like vegetables? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite vegetable? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you eat your vegetables raw ... like salad ... or do you prefer them cooked? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Ron. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I get home from work, I like to relax, have a drink and watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> About 7 <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I take the train. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm usually about midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm pretty tired by then. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 <EOS>
<BOS> That's all I need. <EOS>
<BOS> Not so often but sometimes I can see them when I'm walking home. And sometimes the moon! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> At the moment, yeah, but it is getting warmer, summer is approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a morning person. <EOS>
<BOS> If I have a good reason, but usually I get tired after midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> See you later! <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook Manicotti, Tacos, lots of food. <EOS>
<BOS> Manicotti is...it's a big noodle. It's hollow on the inside and you fill it with different cheeses and then you put red tomato sauce over the top of it and..it's pretty good <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you use Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, um , Parmesan Cheese,a little bit of salt, and basil and stuff and you mix it all together in a pot and then you stuff it in the noodle, and you put the noodle in the pan and shove it in the oven for 35 minutes and let it cook.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, a couple times a month, probably.  <EOS>
<BOS> You got to make it tasty, cause if you add enough salt or Parmesan cheese then it doesn't taste as good.It just tastes like your eating cheese. That's it.  <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome.  <EOS>
<BOS> Okay, now in your city, what is one food I should definitely try?  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. khuushuur?  <EOS>
<BOS> So it's like a dumpling and inside it's meat.  <EOS>
<BOS> Like a flour-based...  <EOS>
<BOS> So people mainly eat beef.  <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything I should buy? Like, what would be a good souvenir or gift from your country?  <EOS>
<BOS> A little tent? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, like a little doll house?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do! <EOS>
<BOS> I kind of alternate between fiction and non-fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm reading two books now. The Ethics of Startrek, which my uncle gave me, which is non-fiction, and I just started it today <EOS>
<BOS> Right now I've just started, so it's about a women who has been having an affair, basically. <EOS>
<BOS> I read on the trains while I'm commuting to work. I read at night, on the weekends.  <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite author. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite season is spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's not so cold but it's not so hot that I'm sweating on the train. I can go to the beach. I can relax with my friends outside. It's very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> My least favorite season in Japan is the rainy season ...because I don't like rain at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now it is the very end of winter. It is just starting to become spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Today, it's very sunny. It's a little cool. A little breezy. It's very nice. I enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have two cameras. I have a digital camera and a SLR camera. <EOS>
<BOS> Recently I am using the digital camera a lot. I can make the photos on my personal computer. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to take photos of people, mainly, sometimes landscapes but mainly people. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, family and friends, sometimes strangers. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like it! No, I'm not shy. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes, or I might make a silly face. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to look at nice landscapes, and cityscapes. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I've got a couple at home, but they're a bit embarassing. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I've got a picture of my mum and dad. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello! <EOS>
<BOS> Sophie Wilkins. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Adelaide, South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a big country town, although it is actually a capital city of South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 1.8 million people. <EOS>
<BOS> I've lived there for about six years. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I was actually born on a farm in mid-north South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> I love it. I love the space, how clean it is, the health, the lifestyle. It's very healthy, and the people as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Temporarily I think yes. For a couple of months and then hopefully come back to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright.  <EOS>
<BOS> This is the Rock Castle. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it? <EOS>
<BOS> What else should people you see? <EOS>
<BOS> Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again? <EOS>
<BOS> The Temple of Tooth Relic. <EOS>
<BOS> Kandy. OK. Well, thanks for the tips Mini. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, in Japan mostly the radio or the internet. <EOS>
<BOS> NPR, but on the military station. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public. <EOS>
<BOS> I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing. <EOS>
<BOS> I am really excited. This summer I'm going to my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. We are having a huge party and I'm really excited. My entire family is going to be there. they're renting a house in Lake Tahoe, which is where my mom grew up, and where my grandparents spent the majority of their life together. We'll be there for a week, on the lake, boating, jet skiing, that whole thing, and then this Saturday we're having a party with people I've never even met. Everyone's gonna be there. I'm really excited. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, gosh, I have no idea. Every time I speak to my mother I hear somebody knew who has been invited and somebody else is going to be there. I'm really excited. It's going to be a lot of fun. My grandparents are crazy. They actually got engaged a month after they met, and February, the shortest month of the year. My grandfather told my grandmother he loved her a week after they met, and then he proposed and then he was in service so he went away until August. They didn't see each other until they got married. Yeah, my grandmother says, "If any of you kids do this, we'll kill you. I can't believe 50 years later they're still together.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to eat whole grain bread or bagels or something that's dark.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite thing to put on bread is tomatoes and I also like honey. <EOS>
<BOS> Not together, no. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like mustard. <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I know people that eat mustard sandwiches, and no! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. Actually, I'm a baker. <EOS>
<BOS> Although, bread is kind of a different branch. I do cakes and stuff like that. I can make bread. My grandmother makes bread all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> OK  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook a little bit. I like cooking. <EOS>
<BOS> Just simple things. I love salad. I make a huge salad. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I can't sing. I just sing for me. On the...when I have a shower. <EOS>
<BOS> No, mainly reaggae. I love reggae. <EOS>
<BOS> Dijuridu!  <EOS>
<BOS> It's an Australian instrument. <EOS>
<BOS> I learned in Switzerland. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's popular. Everybody knows about it. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of years maybe. Maybe 4 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello!  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is Nanju. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is like N-A-N-J-U. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Madras.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's in the South India. <EOS>
<BOS> South India. <EOS>
<BOS> The past four months I am here and working in somewhere, working. <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal, a software engineer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, nothing. Just I know how to program and that's it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I might be, from the 12th standard. like 18th years. From 18 years I am working with the computer. <EOS>
<BOS> My first proper boyfriend was probably when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> His name was Murray. <EOS>
<BOS> He went to a different school, he went to a school near my school. <EOS>
<BOS> We met through mutual friends. His friend knew my friend.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, we did.  <EOS>
<BOS> We went to the cinema. We used to go and listen to music, watch bands, and we used to go to like the fair, and things like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. They really liked him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We went out a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> Two and a half years, nearly three years. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, 17. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, he's living in my flat at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we're like really good friends. <EOS>
<BOS> He's renting my flat off of me. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. So-so. <EOS>
<BOS> Once a week, I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> In Japan, it depends on the season. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say maybe about a 100..15..450 yen per an apple. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Aomori Prefecture. <EOS>
<BOS> Which is in the northern part of Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Red or green or yellow. <EOS>
<BOS> Red. <EOS>
<BOS> Really! Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Does it taste different than the red apples? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. <EOS>
<BOS> Apple Juice, apple pie, and apple tea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I watch the news in the morning and when I come home at night I sometimes watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite TV show. <EOS>
<BOS> I really like going to the movies. I think I go maybe once a month or maybe once every two months. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't rent movies but sometimes I download movies. I like to watch comedies - romantic comedies - and a little bit of drama. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie... I don't know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called "27 Dresses". It is about a girl, or a woman, who is a bridesmaid twenty-seven times. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. <EOS>
<BOS> I do like to read books. Right now, I'm really busy with work so I don't have a lot of time to read but when I'm on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to read non-fiction usually. Biographies of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't go to music concerts. I don't think I've ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say my favorite music would have to be the Beatles. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, so we have all these old 45's when I was younger and this record player, and so we had loads of like Simon and Garfunkel and the Beatles and the Stones so that was the music I grew up listening to, and that's what I still really love. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, probably it's "Happiness is a warm gun" which is on the White Album. <EOS>
<BOS> I love all their albums. But I haven't been to Liverpool yet. I'd like to go. That would be nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> John Lennon, definitely. He's definitely the coolest. I like his songs. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> The earth is big.  <EOS>
<BOS> I'm small on the earth. <EOS>
<BOS> I weigh 65. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> A big house is expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> What is cheap? The 100 Yen shop is cheap. <EOS>
<BOS> About everything. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like the 100 Yen shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. No problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I say, green. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite fruit <EOS>
<BOS> I've had a couple. Much better than the ones I have back in Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say spring, cause it's a combination of warm weather, at the same time it's not hot like it is in the summer. In spring it's a bit cool. You can walk around very relaxed. It the best. It's a combination of all the seasons in one.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie! I'd have to say "Gladiator." Russel Crow. It's a tragic movie about a very strong leader who, how-should-I-say, triumphs over, how-should-I-say, over very overpowering conflicts. It's, um, plus, I'm a bit of an action movie buff. I know it's sad to hear but, it's definitely an interesting movie.  <EOS>
<BOS> Hey! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm OK. How are you? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like summer it's my least favorite summer. <EOS>
<BOS> Because I don't like hot weather. I don't like being hot and sweaty and uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's pretty hot but usually we go away on the weekends to cottages and we go swimming in lakes and stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> Winter or fall. <EOS>
<BOS> In the winter, activities you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite color, black. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruit? OK, it's mango. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I haven't seen a proper mango here, because everything's very small, that is not a very good mango, I know because in India I will get a lot of mangoes, very good taste, and variety of mangoes, I haven't tried, I haven't found anywhere in Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'll eat it raw. The raw mango is very good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. But mango juice, it's not that much good. I eat only raw mango. It will be very good, very good, very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm realy tired. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of, I don't know, my throat's really scratchy, so maybe I'm coming down with something. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I am. I had a private student last night and she told me some wild formula to do. And she asked me to take coca-cola, boil it, add some ginger, and then drink it, however, I'm caffiene sensitive so it kept me up pretty much all night, so I'm really tired today.  <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't bad. If it was probably mid-afternoon, I would love it, but 11 <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No I think I'm just going to stick with the regular cold syrup, and just take that. <EOS>
<BOS> It does. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! <EOS>
<BOS> I play in a Swedish Bubblegum Punk Band. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know, but that's what it says on the CD. <EOS>
<BOS> I play bass guitar. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been playing the guitar for about 12 or 13 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I play a little guitar and a little drums. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> We just play in clubs. Local clubs. <EOS>
<BOS> It's really good for relaxing and having fun. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not. It's only a hobby. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> No, if I am getting opportunity I will be very happy. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's a lot of cobras. I have seen a lot of cobras, and fighting with cobras, each other, but run away so I can not. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have seen a lot of cobras, which is going to be 12 feet. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I will get some sticks and go through about from my home or something. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I won't kill it. Killing of cobra is very illegal in India. Not illegal, it's like god, so we won't. <EOS>
<BOS> So we won't kill that cobra or something. <EOS>
<BOS> My name is Mathew Gill. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from England, from North of England, near Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I was living in Bangkok, in Thailand, before I came to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, something like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Manchester's well know for being quite a grim, industrial town. but it's got a more modern reputation as a center of arts, and there's lots of cool music that comes out of there. Oasis from Manchester is the most famous band, and the Smiths, kind of fifteen years ago, came from Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's a fantastic place, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right, yeah, I'm not Yakuza though, so don't worry. <EOS>
<BOS> I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal. <EOS>
<BOS> I drew the tattoo, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt. <EOS>
<BOS> Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright <EOS>
<BOS> I want to go to Thailand. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I love that country. The people, the food and the culture. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I guess from Narita Airport. <EOS>
<BOS> Approximately 7 hours I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> I would eat Thai food which is something like Pat Thai, which is a Thai noodle, or Tom Yang Gung, which is a Thai soup. <EOS>
<BOS> It's spicy.  <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I can. <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I don't get fired. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> The beach. It's cold here. It's getting warm but I like warm weather. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, another beach person. <EOS>
<BOS> I love the beach. The beach is great. <EOS>
<BOS> It's nice fresh air, beautiful water, you can play in the sand, and my hobby is surfing, so I like to go surfing. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to go as often as possible, usually every weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Usually early on a Saturday morning. Try to beat the crowds. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just relax on the sand, watch the people, maybe have a swim, throw a frisbee. <EOS>
<BOS> Since I was ten years old. <EOS>
<BOS> A towel, and my hat, my sunscreen, my surfboard, wetsuit, some food and water, and maybe a radio. <EOS>
<BOS> The beaches are much bigger and white sand, clean water, very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Catch you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yep. <EOS>
<BOS> It's, I'm working for Tsukigi Fish Market, which is quite big and it's of course the two place, which is inside and outside. I work for outside.  <EOS>
<BOS> Normally sell the fish. It's the main job. But I also have to carry fish,  and you know, um carrying ice and put, put ice, um, yeah, and preserve fish. <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Thanks a lot Jeanna. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hear you, so you say permit, is that the same thing as a license? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. How do you get a permit? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is the DMV? <EOS>

<BOS> A big house. Really!  <EOS>
<BOS> Jeez! 12 rooms. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. OK. I guess. well that's old for America, but that's probably not very old. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. OK. What is in your kitchen? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And what is in the living room? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you watch TV a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, wow, that's the only thing I like is sports <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. OK. Great. Thanks.  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, sounds like a good place. <EOS>

<BOS> You've retired. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you watch soccer on TV? <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Nice. An..and what is you favorite soccer team? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great. All right. Thanks a lot.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to barbecue outside on the grill. <EOS>
<BOS> When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like to dance. <EOS>
<BOS> Right. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been officially taught how to line dance. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke. <EOS>
<BOS> In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort.  <EOS>
<BOS> I try to listen to the teachers now instead of doing my own thing, and I try to complete everything with good quality. <EOS>
<BOS> Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete. <EOS>
<BOS> I played American football, baseball, and soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say football. American football is my best sport. <EOS>
<BOS> I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two. <EOS>
<BOS> I played at the University of Hawaii. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. Now, you grew up in Southern California. What was it like growing up on the beach in the summer? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you learn how to surf? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. Even in winter it's too cold, the water. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, where would this house be? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Would yo buy a house in the city or the country? <EOS>
<BOS> So, it'd be in Japan.? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, would you have animals at this house? <EOS>
<BOS> Really. No dog? <EOS>
<BOS> You got to have a dog, man. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a driver's license? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So, how long have you had your driver's license?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How do you get a driver's license in your country?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Did you get a perfect score on your driving test? <EOS>
<BOS> Do all the members of your family drive?  <EOS>
<BOS> So, what did you study in high school?  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. Well, that's kind of similar. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, what did you do in high school? Any clubs or anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, you're quite athletic. What sport did you like the most? <EOS>
<BOS> Really! <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think you'll pick it up some time in the future? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! Not too many lakes in Tokyo. Um, anything esle? Any other memories about high school? <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like a good time. <EOS>
<BOS> And who is the best player in the world? Cricket player? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, and he's from India?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK, is he from the south of India or? <EOS>
<BOS> He's from north India. And he's a very good batter? <EOS>
<BOS> Batsman <EOS>
<BOS> How many times do you get to try to hit the ball? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really but you only get one time. Like in baseball you bat and another person bats <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really,  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow and do you play cricket with your friends? <EOS>
<BOS> You said this guys name, what's it, I'm sorry? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I don't know him. See I like baseball. Do you know who Barry Bonds is? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that's OK. You teach me about cricket and I'll teach you about baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> We start school at 8 <EOS>
<BOS> We go back. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, because in Mongolia we have two parts. In the morning, the high school students go to the school and from 1 <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> In Mongolia, the mother and father they usually work and when I finish my school I just go back and make my own food, because in Mongolia mothers work is not to, like, stay at home or do housework. Kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and wash their clothes and that's your work and usually the mothers don't do that kind of thing.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> It really depends on the school but for me, like, I was studying in an international school so I had to study quite hard to get the level still. So for me, I studied after school...I'd rather study at night, so I studied like 3 or 4 hours at night. So that's my study habit.  <EOS>
<BOS> Not really compared to other students.  <EOS>
<BOS> So can you tell me more about the weather? It's always sunny? It never rains? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. Can you tell me more about the beach?  <EOS>
<BOS> Can you tell me maybe about the nature in Hawaii? <EOS>
<BOS> What's a wallaby? <EOS>
<BOS> What do they look like?  <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting. Any other interesting animals in Hawaii? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any animals that live in the sea?  <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any whales?  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, there are a lot of animals that live in Hawaii. Sounds like a great place to visit.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to know what's going on in the world, so I usually watch CNN or BBC. <EOS>
<BOS> Usually, yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't go to the movies very often, maybe twice a year, I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I rent movies more than I go to the cinema, but also not very often. <EOS>
<BOS> I like funny movies. Comedies. <EOS>
<BOS> I watched Home Alone last night but it was on TV. I didn't rent the movie. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like reading, so I don't read books very often. The only time I do read books is for school purposes. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, my major is International Relations, so usually I read International Relations books, if I have to read. <EOS>
<BOS> Not for entertainment. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I try to watch the movies on the airplane. <EOS>
<BOS> I go to concerts once in awhile. In Hawaii, there aren't many concerts so when they're are concerts, I try to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I like Hawaiian music so I go to Hawaiian concerts, and if a big star from America comes, I usually try to go also. <EOS>
<BOS> Right, music concerts. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you read a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Ah, you're the man. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, how many books do you get through a week? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's pretty good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hear you. It rots your mind, I think. Ah, also, what kind of books you like to read? What kind of genres? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool, so actually, when you read, like where do you normally read? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool. I love to read on the trains.  <EOS>
<BOS> Must be pretty competitive. <EOS>
<BOS> How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10? <EOS>
<BOS> I wanted to be a baseball player. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm still dreaming. <EOS>
<BOS> Traditional Hawaiian food is usually cooked under the ground in a hole with hot rocks and it cooks for maybe six hours or seven hours and when you take it out, it's very salty because we use a lot of salt and it tastes really good ... usually meat ... usually pork and other vegetables like taro and potato.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite Hawaiian dish is called Lao-Lao. It's pork or fish wrapped in leaves and put inside the underground oven and it's very salty and very good. <EOS>
<BOS> The flavor is salt and also the leaf flavor that it's wrapped in. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite dessert has to be cake and ice-cream together. I love to eat cake and ice-cream together. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite ice-cream flavor is strawberry, and I like to eat that with chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> Not so much. I don't like to eat vegetables but I can eat them if somebody cooks them for me. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite vegetable ... I don't have a favorite vegetable but I can eat vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, carrots. Those types of things. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer them cooked. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you usually get home at night? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How do you go home? Do you drive or take the train? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And when do you go to bed? <EOS>
<BOS> At midnight. That's pretty late. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you wake up the next day? <EOS>
<BOS> Man, you're a strong guy! Um..how often do you look at the stars? <EOS>
<BOS> The moon. OK! Can you see the stars from your house? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And do you prefer the morning or the evening? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, me, too. I'm the same. Last question, can you stay up all night? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Yeah, me too. All right, thanks Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So what is Manicotti?  <EOS>
<BOS> So how do you make it? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds really good. How often do you make manicotti? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the secret to good manicotti? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Well I'll remember that. Thanks a lot Jessica. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, because in the fall we have a celebration called Naadam and that's the best time to go. And you get to see horse racing and archery and wrestling and so many tourist come to Mongolia at that time.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well I would say khuushuur.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Everyone loves it. And for me, I love it too. It looks like dumpling but fried and it's more bigger and inside is meat.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's a flour, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Beef.  <EOS>
<BOS> We don't really eat chicken and we don't eat fish. Well, we have a river fish. It's like really delicious but then we don't have sea so seafood is not popular at all.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> Probably, it's better to go to the countryside because if you go to Ulan Bator it's just the same as other cities around the world. But the countryside is a whole different world. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, in the department stores they have sections for Mongolian traditional gifts and stuff so probably you can get the tent -- a small tent. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, and then if you open the door you can actually see all the furniture is inside it. So it's kind of interesting.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you read usually? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What are you reading now? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, OK. It looks like a pretty good book. What is it about? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you read? When do you find time to read? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is your favorite author? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. it's kind of hard to pick. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, why is that? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is your least favorite season? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What season are we in right now? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the weather like today? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, which one do you prefer? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you like to take photos of? <EOS>
<BOS> Now you mean your family or strangers? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, OK. Do you mind being photographed? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you smile when people take your picture? <EOS>
<BOS> A silly face! OK. Um..what kind of pictures do you like to look at? <EOS>
<BOS> Cityscapes! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great! And do you have pictures of yourself as a child? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you have any pictures of your family in your wallet? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, Wow! Wow, that's nice! OK. Thanks, Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> Sophie Wilkins. Sophie, where are you from? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, nice. Adelaide. What's Adelaide like? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Is it like over a million people or? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's pretty big. Nice. How long have you lived there? <EOS>
<BOS> Six years! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, nice. Farmer girl.  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great, so after Japan are you going to go back to Australia? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the Kings and Queens built, like castles. We have a castle called... it's called the Rock Castle. It's called Sigirya, so it's very beautiful. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's... the castle is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It's really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I'm not sure. Sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches all over the place, blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It's very beautiful. That's the second thing. <EOS>
<BOS> M-hm. I mean, not popular amongst Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple. <EOS>
<BOS> Temple of Tooth Relic. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. OK. What radio station? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And what internet websites do you listen to? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How much of the news do you think is true? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks Keri. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's wonderful. So how many of your family member will be there? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What kind of bread do you eat? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you like to put on bread? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. But not together? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like mustard? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I love mustard. I eat mustard and bread just plain. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Can you make bread? <EOS>

<BOS> What's the reasoning behind the tattoo? Why did you get it? <EOS>
<BOS> So, you drew the tattoo. <EOS>
<BOS> Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is the chest the worst place? <EOS>
<BOS> Thailand. Why Thailand? <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Why do you love the beach? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh..nice. How often do you go surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you go to the beach? Saturday? Sunday? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you do at the beach besides surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, since you were ten. That's great! -- What do you take to the beach, when you go? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Now, you are from Australia. How are the beaches  different in Australia than Japan? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Well, sounds good. Thanks a lot Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> Outside? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, well what do you do everyday at the fish market? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, what time do you start work? <EOS>
<BOS> 4 <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks, Daisuke. <EOS>
<BOS> Cookies and brownies and cake. <EOS>
<BOS> I am terrible at singing. I don't like going to karaoke and I don't like to sing. I like music, but I can't sing for my life. I, yesterday, or I guess in class it was a students birthday and I made my students sing Happy Birthday but they wouldn't start so I had to start them off singing and my voice was so bad, they started laughing at me, so I'm just a terrible singer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not a good dancer. I can't dance at all. I used to when I was younger, my parents would enroll me in ballet classes, so I did ballet for six years but I am not very good at dancing. <EOS>
<BOS> I was a good student because I'm a dork. No, yeah, I think I was a good student. I tried hard in all of my classes. I always did my homework. I was always focused and took notes during class. If I didn't understand something, I would either ask questions in class or speak to the teacher or professor after class.  <EOS>
<BOS> That's a tricky question. I like sports, and I like playing sports. I don't think I'm a very good athlete, probably compared to you, I'm probably not, but I really enjoy playing sports. In high school, I played soccer. I ran cross-country. I played ice-hockey and a little bit of lacrosse. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite sport was ice-hockey. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to mail this package to Italy. <EOS>
<BOS> Some toys and baby clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> I have it here. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. When will my package arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> I would like your fastest shipping. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> With my credit card. <EOS>
<BOS> No. That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> You too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> My son was in an auto accident last night. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago. <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Alice. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Transmission problems can be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you afford a new car? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car. <EOS>
<BOS> This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice to hear. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a toothache. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! 4 pm is perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ok. I will be there at 3 <EOS>
<BOS> Bye. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join me? <EOS>
<BOS> ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market. <EOS>
<BOS> You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you have any? <EOS>
<BOS> They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I can wait for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work. <EOS>
<BOS> I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am. I work out for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, how about lifting weights? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about aerobics? <EOS>
<BOS> Yoga? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market. <EOS>
<BOS> The one down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I always go to that market. <EOS>
<BOS> It's always so crowded there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I still like the smaller store. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been waiting? <EOS>
<BOS> That's 30 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> There are still several people ahead of us. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later. <EOS>
<BOS> Bye Kevin. <EOS>
<BOS> There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I hope no one was seriously injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I didn't see it happen. <EOS>
<BOS> After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving. <EOS>
<BOS> We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Peter. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Does your younger son loan him money? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny and smart. He's like a bank. <EOS>
<BOS> This is giving him great experience. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but the line is usually very long. <EOS>
<BOS> Overseas to Korea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think the line will be long today? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go have lunch instead? <EOS>
<BOS> Why Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to go. <EOS>
<BOS> But it hurt last time. <EOS>
<BOS> But I brush my teeth every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I don't have any cavities this time. <EOS>
<BOS> What time are you picking me up? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll tell my teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work. <EOS>
<BOS> Three? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. What about riding your bike to work? <EOS>
<BOS> You can carpool with someone. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work with anyone who lives near you? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you want to ride with your boss? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal to be nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to get him a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Did your auto insurance go up a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> When will that be? <EOS>
<BOS> Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of procedure? <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That should help. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's important to have dental insurance. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. <EOS>
<BOS> To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They are all overdue. <EOS>
<BOS> We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room. <EOS>
<BOS> About two months. <EOS>
<BOS> I found the notices in his room too. <EOS>
<BOS> He said he couldn't find them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is. <EOS>
<BOS> Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm learning that now. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> The mechanic is my brother-in-law. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car? <EOS>
<BOS> At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper. <EOS>
<BOS> It's supposed to be ready this afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent. <EOS>
<BOS> They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a few minutes before they close. <EOS>
<BOS> They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school? <EOS>
<BOS> I like pretzels and potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I go to the market with you? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to take break. I've been studying all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we get ice cream on the way home? <EOS>
<BOS> I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test. <EOS>
<BOS> What is in the package? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any breakables? Is it fragile? <EOS>
<BOS> Please fill out this form. Print clearly. Sometimes, it is hard to read. <EOS>
<BOS> It depends on your shipping choice. <EOS>
<BOS> It will be there in one week. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the cost. How would you like to pay? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Is there anything else I can help you with today? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you. Have a nice day. <EOS>
<BOS> Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! <EOS>
<BOS> How scary for him. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible! <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think he will go to jail? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I help you with anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he close to us? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I would have to buy a used car. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking. <EOS>
<BOS> Will this be your first visit? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything wrong with your teeth? <EOS>
<BOS> We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. We'll see you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too. But my car is at the repair shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing serious. Just an oil change. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Which one are you going to? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me check my purse and see if I have any coupons too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I use their coupons all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons? <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you leaving? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll be right back. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year. <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you go in the morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am? That's too early. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm asleep at 5 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I hate running. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have the strength to lift weights. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too much jumping around? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one? <EOS>
<BOS> Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> The market is going out of business? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But it has a bigger selection of things. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale. <EOS>
<BOS> I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work. <EOS>
<BOS> I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use it for my business. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been here since 8 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. It's been a long wait. <EOS>
<BOS> Many people left. They were tired of waiting. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. See you another time. <EOS>
<BOS> Was anyone hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident? <EOS>
<BOS> You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> That was smart. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! <EOS>
<BOS> I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but he adds on interest. <EOS>
<BOS> He wants to be a banker one day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need to go to the post office? <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you sending your package? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a big package? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. Today is Monday. Most people go on Monday since the post office is closed on Sunday. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's a better idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a dentist appointment. <EOS>
<BOS> It's just a check-up. <EOS>
<BOS> That is because you had a cavity. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but you eat too much candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> 2 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> I will also call the school office. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my boss. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas. <EOS>
<BOS> He's a little nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school. <EOS>
<BOS> No, he has to share with my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Our insurance rate doubled. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive. <EOS>
<BOS> In two years. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like the part-time job idea better. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm here for a procedure. <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected. <EOS>
<BOS> A little. I took some medicine this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't think it was important. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> Under his bed? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you find them? <EOS>
<BOS> How late are they? <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you receive notices before? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't he return them? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he in trouble? <EOS>
<BOS> That's five weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Again? What's wrong with it this time? <EOS>
<BOS> That's weird. It's not even an old car. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't know? What is he doing then? <EOS>
<BOS> You should take it to another mechanic. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't sound very trustworthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe too cheap isn't always better. <EOS>
<BOS> You should demand a refund. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is it complicated? <EOS>
<BOS> Where is your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you ok? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. When do you get your car back? <EOS>
<BOS> That's quick. <EOS>
<BOS> Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced? <EOS>
<BOS> I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That's good to know. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll check it out tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close? <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you usually get there? <EOS>
<BOS> What happens if you're late? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you ever been late? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Is your boss understanding? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What kind of snacks? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will pick up some fruits too. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruits are healthy for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with your homework? <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should stay home and study. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We will only be gone for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you needed to study. <EOS>
