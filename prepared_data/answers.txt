<BOS> That's right. <EOS>
<BOS> I was born in Montreal and I lived there for four years, the first four years but uh, I grew up in Calgary, which is Alberta, in the city of Banff. <EOS>
<BOS> Childhood I was into books. I was a big reader. I used to go the the library with my mother. And the first big trip I took overseas was when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> On this trip I went to Liverpool which is where my mother is from. So I went to Liverpool that time and Wales and Scotland and five or six trips after that. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could sing, but no, I don't sing.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just not ballroom dancing, but just the ordinary one, you know, the just kind of just normal...nothing special.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to cook vegetables, yeah. Vegetables! OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Very much so I go, I used to go to the gym three times a week before I arrived in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like a clean place, but I don't really like to clean, no! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> I live in quite a big house. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> About 12. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 80 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not very old for England. <EOS>
<BOS> A big round table and a cooker. <EOS>
<BOS> A TV and a video. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Anything. I don't really like watching sport. <EOS>
<BOS> Some sports are OK. I don't like watching golf, snooker, and sports like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a lot people think the summers in Norway are really cold, but actually they're not. Maybe everything, the weather is changing because of El Nino effect, I don't know, but we've had, for the last four or five years, we've had pretty warm summers. It gets close to 30 degrees centigrade, and which is enjoyable I guess, and there's no humidity. It's nice and dry and it's just pleasant weather really. Yeah, and what we do in the summers is different. Some people have a house on small islands on the coast, or some people have a house on the mountains, and you can either go to the mountains and enjoy the lakes, the forests, or you can go to the coast and enjoy the beach, the water, go fishing, so there's plenty of things to do in the summer, yeah, and we get a lot of tourist coming in the summer though, because it's not that hot. It's just pleasant and enjoyable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it is. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like American food.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like hamburgers.  <EOS>
<BOS> That is my favorite dish. My favorite hamburger place is right near where I went to university and they have this hamburger called the Danish Burger, and the Danish Burger has blue cheese inside the hamburger, so I love ... my favorite dish has to be the Danish Burger. <EOS>
<BOS> I love french fries but I know that eating hamburger and french fries is a little bit unhealthy so I always replace the french fries for a salad. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite dessert has to be chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like chocolate cake by itself. Anything else? I like brownie sundaes, like brownies and choc ... brownies with vanilla ice-cream. I guess my favorite dessert is anything chocolaty.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like all vegetables. I like them cooked or raw but I don't like raw onions. <EOS>
<BOS> I really can't eat onions raw. That's probably the only vegetable I can't eat raw. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, um, I wanna be a physician's assistant.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, normally when you go into a, into the doctor's office, you wouldn't usually get, well you would get your doctor all they do is check, give you check-ups or you know maybe take out stitches or something, not surgery. You just go in and do the little things. So the doctor does not have to do them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Nothing wrong with that.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lot of schooling. You have like six years, four or six years of college and you obviously take the,like nursing and other kinds of classes like that and then you do like um, two, two or four years at like a hospital as a.. <EOS>
<BOS> Like, like you're actually doing. <EOS>
<BOS> An intern, yeah! An internship for two or four years at a hospital.  <EOS>
<BOS> And then you hopefully go on and maybe have your own little doctor's place and open that up or something. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you.  <EOS>
<BOS> Playing soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! <EOS>
<BOS> Now I don't play, but before I played about three or four times a week. <EOS>
<BOS> I've retired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I came to Japan. I had a soccer team, but now that I work in Japan I can't play for my soccer team at home. <EOS>
<BOS> These days? No! No time. Always working at Seitoku. <EOS>
<BOS> That's hard to say. Right now, there's a kid named Ronaldino for Brazil. Maybe he will be the best.  <EOS>
<BOS> Deep Cove Royals. That's my soccer team. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to cook? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you put on your barbecue? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Good. Next, do you think you're a good dancer? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you not like to dance? <EOS>
<BOS> At all? <EOS>
<BOS> So you don't dance at all? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you like to sing? <EOS>
<BOS> Good. That's good. Do you think you're a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> How were you not a good student growing up? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you talk more about your effort? What do you do to try to be a good student? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. And, last do you think that you're a good athlete? <EOS>
<BOS> What sports did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one is your best sport? <EOS>
<BOS> How long did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> So for eleven years. And you played when you were in university? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's warm, and blue skies, and fluffy white clouds. <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. It was a lot of fun. It's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I tried a couple of times but I didn't want to learn in the summer time cause the beaches are too crowded so I tried in the winter but the water is very cold so I gave up after a couple of tries. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the Pacific's cold. <EOS>
<BOS> 10,000,000. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, first thing I'd do, I'd probably buy a nice house for me and my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I don't know. We'll have to talk about that with the wife but probably somewhere near Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, a little further out of the middle of Tokyo. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, in Japan, but some place not too crowded. <EOS>
<BOS> Not if I could help it. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, maybe a dog, but an outside dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. <EOS>
<BOS> I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I got it when I was 17 actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I think it's changed since I was a teenager. At that time, you get a learner's permit. And then you start driving with your parents. And you'd also go to drivers ed. And then you had to pass a driving test. I think a written test as well.  <EOS>
<BOS> I was close to perfect, yeah. I can't remember my exact score but I remember it was pretty good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It was great. Lots of fun. Lots of friends. Learned quite a bit at school. <EOS>
<BOS> I studied mainly sciences actually.  <EOS>
<BOS> Biology. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Oh, No! I didn't. I went on to do a bachelor of technology. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of similar. Related. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I did rowing for the school. I played basketball, played tennis, was on the swimming team. <EOS>
<BOS> Rowing. <EOS>
<BOS> No, unfortunately not. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, maybe, if I'm around a lake or a river. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, lots of parties. It was good.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, sure. <EOS>
<BOS> According to my view, Mr. Sachin Tendulkar is the best player. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he's from India. <EOS>
<BOS> He's north India. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, batsman. <EOS>
<BOS> How many times you bat? <EOS>
<BOS> Until you are out you can bat. Until you are out you can bat. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not like that. Until you get out you can play. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes, I used to play cricket with my friends. <EOS>
<BOS> Sachin Tendulkar. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, sorry, I don't know anything about baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> How long is a typical class? Do you have, let's say, six classes a day, each class is one hour?  <EOS>
<BOS> And then, what do you do in the afternoon?  <EOS>
<BOS> You go home? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so you split the school? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, so the children have to do all that work? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well, Hawaii is my home, but to people not from Hawaii, I think Hawaii is famous for its nice weather, its warm all year round, also it's known for its beaches. The beaches are very nice. And it's also known for its warm hospitality. The people are also very nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> It does rain, but often it rains and it's sunny at the same time, so we have a lot of rainbows. Hawaii is also famous for rainbows.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have beaches on all shores of the island -- all our islands. There's many beaches to choose from. And often, some beaches have big waves, some beaches have small waves, and you can choose which beach to go to depending on whether you want to surf in big waves or you want to swim where there's no waves. <EOS>
<BOS> We have forests, so there's lots of animals, like birds, and small animals like wallabies <EOS>
<BOS> Wallabies, they're those little mammals from Australia and they were introduced in Hawaii and now they're wild in Hawaii. They've become their own species.  <EOS>
<BOS> They look like little kangaroos I think.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have a lot of pigs, wild pigs. We like to go hunting for them and we like to eat them.  <EOS>
<BOS> We have nice coral reefs, so there's lots of beautiful fish in our coral reefs and many people like to go snorkeling to look at our reefs. We also have turtles and seals in Hawaii.  <EOS>
<BOS> We do have whales during the months of March till February I believe. They come from Alaska and they come to Hawaii during those months and then they return to Alaska.  <EOS>
<BOS> Why just the news? <EOS>
<BOS> And that's it. Nothing else? <EOS>
<BOS> Usually? <EOS>
<BOS> But that's it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of movies do you like? <EOS>
<BOS> Comedies. What's the most recent movie you watched? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you read books? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of books do you read for school? <EOS>
<BOS> If you have to read. So nothing? No books for pleasure? <EOS>
<BOS> So when you're on the airplane, you don't read? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How often do you go to concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you go see, or what type of concerts? <EOS>
<BOS> So music concerts. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, Ron, thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's right. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I read a lot. In fact I don't have a television. <EOS>
<BOS> Seriously, I only read. <EOS>
<BOS> A week! Ah, at least one a week, because I work all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I enjoy reading because television doesn't give you imagination, yeah I prefer reading. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, let's see, I've got a lot of nonfiction, a lot of comedy. <EOS>
<BOS> Where do I normally read? On the trains, actually. I'm always reading on the trains. I read because I'm always traveling to work. A lot of pleasure. And it's funny because I meet people on the trains when I'm reading, they look over at my book. <EOS>
<BOS> My dream job is to become a diplomat representing my country, preferably in Japan. That's why I came to Japan to learn Japanese and hopefully obtain a master degree in International Relations. After getting my master's degree in International Relations, I would like to go home and enter the diplomat school for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is a three year program, and then, after that hopefully come back to Japan and work for the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's very competitive, but I think if you know a certain language that not many people speak it gives you a competitive edge nevertheless so that's why I came to Japan because I know at this stage there are only 300 hundred people from Norway living in Japan and not all of them are here to study Japanese, they represent different companies or schools, or they're missionaries so, that's the track I'm on right now but we'll see how it goes in the end. <EOS>
<BOS> No, when I was ten I probably didn't know what I wanted to do. I was just too busy playing in the street, you know, having fun with my friends and these things. When I was that young I really didn't have a dream job like fireman, police. I never really went through that stage, you know. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright, fair enough. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's good. <EOS>
<BOS> What exactly is Hawaiian food? <EOS>
<BOS> So then what's your favorite Hawaiian dish? <EOS>
<BOS> So the flavor is just salt? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite dessert or junk food? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite ice-cream flavor? <EOS>
<BOS> Mm, sounds good. Do you like vegetables? <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite vegetable? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you eat your vegetables raw ... like salad ... or do you prefer them cooked? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Ron. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I get home from work, I like to relax, have a drink and watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> About 7 <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I take the train. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm usually about midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm pretty tired by then. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 <EOS>
<BOS> That's all I need. <EOS>
<BOS> Not so often but sometimes I can see them when I'm walking home. And sometimes the moon! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> At the moment, yeah, but it is getting warmer, summer is approaching. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a morning person. <EOS>
<BOS> If I have a good reason, but usually I get tired after midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> See you later! <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook Manicotti, Tacos, lots of food. <EOS>
<BOS> Manicotti is...it's a big noodle. It's hollow on the inside and you fill it with different cheeses and then you put red tomato sauce over the top of it and..it's pretty good <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you use Ricotta cheese, Mozzarella cheese, um , Parmesan Cheese,a little bit of salt, and basil and stuff and you mix it all together in a pot and then you stuff it in the noodle, and you put the noodle in the pan and shove it in the oven for 35 minutes and let it cook.  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, a couple times a month, probably.  <EOS>
<BOS> You got to make it tasty, cause if you add enough salt or Parmesan cheese then it doesn't taste as good.It just tastes like your eating cheese. That's it.  <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome.  <EOS>
<BOS> Okay, now in your city, what is one food I should definitely try?  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. khuushuur?  <EOS>
<BOS> So it's like a dumpling and inside it's meat.  <EOS>
<BOS> Like a flour-based...  <EOS>
<BOS> So people mainly eat beef.  <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything I should buy? Like, what would be a good souvenir or gift from your country?  <EOS>
<BOS> A little tent? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, like a little doll house?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do! <EOS>
<BOS> I kind of alternate between fiction and non-fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm reading two books now. The Ethics of Startrek, which my uncle gave me, which is non-fiction, and I just started it today <EOS>
<BOS> Right now I've just started, so it's about a women who has been having an affair, basically. <EOS>
<BOS> I read on the trains while I'm commuting to work. I read at night, on the weekends.  <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite author. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite season is spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's not so cold but it's not so hot that I'm sweating on the train. I can go to the beach. I can relax with my friends outside. It's very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> My least favorite season in Japan is the rainy season ...because I don't like rain at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now it is the very end of winter. It is just starting to become spring. <EOS>
<BOS> Today, it's very sunny. It's a little cool. A little breezy. It's very nice. I enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have two cameras. I have a digital camera and a SLR camera. <EOS>
<BOS> Recently I am using the digital camera a lot. I can make the photos on my personal computer. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to take photos of people, mainly, sometimes landscapes but mainly people. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, family and friends, sometimes strangers. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like it! No, I'm not shy. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes, or I might make a silly face. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to look at nice landscapes, and cityscapes. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I've got a couple at home, but they're a bit embarassing. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I've got a picture of my mum and dad. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello! <EOS>
<BOS> Sophie Wilkins. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Adelaide, South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a big country town, although it is actually a capital city of South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> It's about 1.8 million people. <EOS>
<BOS> I've lived there for about six years. <EOS>
<BOS> Mm! <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I was actually born on a farm in mid-north South Australia. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> I love it. I love the space, how clean it is, the health, the lifestyle. It's very healthy, and the people as well. <EOS>
<BOS> Temporarily I think yes. For a couple of months and then hopefully come back to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright.  <EOS>
<BOS> This is the Rock Castle. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. That's really cool, so this rock castle, how old is it? <EOS>
<BOS> What else should people you see? <EOS>
<BOS> Surfing is popular in Sri Lanka? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So, we've got the Rock Castle, surfing on the beach. Anything else?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK, I'm sorry. Can you say the name of that again? <EOS>
<BOS> The Temple of Tooth Relic. <EOS>
<BOS> Kandy. OK. Well, thanks for the tips Mini. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, in Japan mostly the radio or the internet. <EOS>
<BOS> NPR, but on the military station. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, usually it is just AP news or whatever. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. That's a tough question. I think that because there're so many journalists that often what makes into the papers is fairly accurate, but unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to sway public opinion, so you have to kind of weed through things and consider why that news story is made public. <EOS>
<BOS> I think most people in the states get the news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The evening news sort of thing. <EOS>
<BOS> I am really excited. This summer I'm going to my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. We are having a huge party and I'm really excited. My entire family is going to be there. they're renting a house in Lake Tahoe, which is where my mom grew up, and where my grandparents spent the majority of their life together. We'll be there for a week, on the lake, boating, jet skiing, that whole thing, and then this Saturday we're having a party with people I've never even met. Everyone's gonna be there. I'm really excited. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, gosh, I have no idea. Every time I speak to my mother I hear somebody knew who has been invited and somebody else is going to be there. I'm really excited. It's going to be a lot of fun. My grandparents are crazy. They actually got engaged a month after they met, and February, the shortest month of the year. My grandfather told my grandmother he loved her a week after they met, and then he proposed and then he was in service so he went away until August. They didn't see each other until they got married. Yeah, my grandmother says, "If any of you kids do this, we'll kill you. I can't believe 50 years later they're still together.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to eat whole grain bread or bagels or something that's dark.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite thing to put on bread is tomatoes and I also like honey. <EOS>
<BOS> Not together, no. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like mustard. <EOS>
<BOS> No, no. I know people that eat mustard sandwiches, and no! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I can. Actually, I'm a baker. <EOS>
<BOS> Although, bread is kind of a different branch. I do cakes and stuff like that. I can make bread. My grandmother makes bread all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> OK  <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook a little bit. I like cooking. <EOS>
<BOS> Just simple things. I love salad. I make a huge salad. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I can't sing. I just sing for me. On the...when I have a shower. <EOS>
<BOS> No, mainly reaggae. I love reggae. <EOS>
<BOS> Dijuridu!  <EOS>
<BOS> It's an Australian instrument. <EOS>
<BOS> I learned in Switzerland. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's popular. Everybody knows about it. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of years maybe. Maybe 4 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello!  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is Nanju. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my name is like N-A-N-J-U. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from Madras.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's in the South India. <EOS>
<BOS> South India. <EOS>
<BOS> The past four months I am here and working in somewhere, working. <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal, a software engineer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, nothing. Just I know how to program and that's it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I might be, from the 12th standard. like 18th years. From 18 years I am working with the computer. <EOS>
<BOS> My first proper boyfriend was probably when I was 14. <EOS>
<BOS> His name was Murray. <EOS>
<BOS> He went to a different school, he went to a school near my school. <EOS>
<BOS> We met through mutual friends. His friend knew my friend.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, we did.  <EOS>
<BOS> We went to the cinema. We used to go and listen to music, watch bands, and we used to go to like the fair, and things like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. They really liked him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We went out a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> Two and a half years, nearly three years. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, 17. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, he's living in my flat at the moment. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we're like really good friends. <EOS>
<BOS> He's renting my flat off of me. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. So-so. <EOS>
<BOS> Once a week, I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> In Japan, it depends on the season. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say maybe about a 100..15..450 yen per an apple. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Aomori Prefecture. <EOS>
<BOS> Which is in the northern part of Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Red or green or yellow. <EOS>
<BOS> Red. <EOS>
<BOS> Really! Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Does it taste different than the red apples? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. <EOS>
<BOS> Apple Juice, apple pie, and apple tea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, yes. It's very good stuff, and I've got one recipe that comes to mind that has to do with chicken and rice. You can take several pieces of chicken and boil them in water with some salt until the chicken is cooked. You take out the pieces and with a couple of forks, shred the meat. In a pan you put garlic, onions, olive oil, and tomatoes. Fry that up. Put the chicken on top and then put a puree of tomatoes on top of that and just saute that for awhile and you can put it over white rice and you'll have yourself a nice meal  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's very good, and for change you can always add green peppers, red peppers and make it very colorful, and serve it with some white plantains and a little Cuban drink and you are good to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I watch the news in the morning and when I come home at night I sometimes watch TV. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a favorite TV show. <EOS>
<BOS> I really like going to the movies. I think I go maybe once a month or maybe once every two months. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't rent movies but sometimes I download movies. I like to watch comedies - romantic comedies - and a little bit of drama. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie... I don't know if it was my favorite movie, but a movie that I watched recently is called "27 Dresses". It is about a girl, or a woman, who is a bridesmaid twenty-seven times. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. <EOS>
<BOS> I do like to read books. Right now, I'm really busy with work so I don't have a lot of time to read but when I'm on vacation or whenever I have free time, I like to read books. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to read non-fiction usually. Biographies of people, and I also like to read about like teaching practices so that I can become a better teacher and a little bit of fiction. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't go to music concerts. I don't think I've ever been to one actually but I like to go see musicals and I also like to go to sporting events. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say my favorite music would have to be the Beatles. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, so we have all these old 45's when I was younger and this record player, and so we had loads of like Simon and Garfunkel and the Beatles and the Stones so that was the music I grew up listening to, and that's what I still really love. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, probably it's "Happiness is a warm gun" which is on the White Album. <EOS>
<BOS> I love all their albums. But I haven't been to Liverpool yet. I'd like to go. That would be nice.  <EOS>
<BOS> John Lennon, definitely. He's definitely the coolest. I like his songs. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> The earth is big.  <EOS>
<BOS> I'm small on the earth. <EOS>
<BOS> I weigh 65. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> A big house is expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> What is cheap? The 100 Yen shop is cheap. <EOS>
<BOS> About everything. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I like the 100 Yen shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. No problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I say, green. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite fruit <EOS>
<BOS> I've had a couple. Much better than the ones I have back in Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd say spring, cause it's a combination of warm weather, at the same time it's not hot like it is in the summer. In spring it's a bit cool. You can walk around very relaxed. It the best. It's a combination of all the seasons in one.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite movie! I'd have to say "Gladiator." Russel Crow. It's a tragic movie about a very strong leader who, how-should-I-say, triumphs over, how-should-I-say, over very overpowering conflicts. It's, um, plus, I'm a bit of an action movie buff. I know it's sad to hear but, it's definitely an interesting movie.  <EOS>
<BOS> Hey! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm OK. How are you? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like summer it's my least favorite summer. <EOS>
<BOS> Because I don't like hot weather. I don't like being hot and sweaty and uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's pretty hot but usually we go away on the weekends to cottages and we go swimming in lakes and stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Canada. <EOS>
<BOS> Winter or fall. <EOS>
<BOS> In the winter, activities you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite color, black. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruit? OK, it's mango. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I haven't seen a proper mango here, because everything's very small, that is not a very good mango, I know because in India I will get a lot of mangoes, very good taste, and variety of mangoes, I haven't tried, I haven't found anywhere in Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'll eat it raw. The raw mango is very good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. But mango juice, it's not that much good. I eat only raw mango. It will be very good, very good, very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm realy tired. <EOS>
<BOS> Kind of, I don't know, my throat's really scratchy, so maybe I'm coming down with something. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I am. I had a private student last night and she told me some wild formula to do. And she asked me to take coca-cola, boil it, add some ginger, and then drink it, however, I'm caffiene sensitive so it kept me up pretty much all night, so I'm really tired today.  <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't bad. If it was probably mid-afternoon, I would love it, but 11 <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> No I think I'm just going to stick with the regular cold syrup, and just take that. <EOS>
<BOS> It does. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! <EOS>
<BOS> I play in a Swedish Bubblegum Punk Band. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know, but that's what it says on the CD. <EOS>
<BOS> I play bass guitar. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been playing the guitar for about 12 or 13 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I play a little guitar and a little drums. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> We just play in clubs. Local clubs. <EOS>
<BOS> It's really good for relaxing and having fun. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not. It's only a hobby. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> No, if I am getting opportunity I will be very happy. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's a lot of cobras. I have seen a lot of cobras, and fighting with cobras, each other, but run away so I can not. <EOS>
<BOS> No <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have seen a lot of cobras, which is going to be 12 feet. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I will get some sticks and go through about from my home or something. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I won't kill it. Killing of cobra is very illegal in India. Not illegal, it's like god, so we won't. <EOS>
<BOS> So we won't kill that cobra or something. <EOS>
<BOS> My name is Mathew Gill. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm from England, from North of England, near Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I was living in Bangkok, in Thailand, before I came to Japan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, something like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Manchester's well know for being quite a grim, industrial town. but it's got a more modern reputation as a center of arts, and there's lots of cool music that comes out of there. Oasis from Manchester is the most famous band, and the Smiths, kind of fifteen years ago, came from Manchester. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's a fantastic place, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right, yeah, I'm not Yakuza though, so don't worry. <EOS>
<BOS> I got the tattoo because I used to actually work as a tattooist, a long time ago but now I stopped that, so I can come traveling. I designed the tattoo myself. I drew it onto paper then I got my friend to actually tattoo it onto my body. I got a wolf really because I really love animals, and a wolf is my favorite animal. <EOS>
<BOS> I drew the tattoo, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it did hurt, but tattoos can vary in amounts of pain depending where on your body it was. The chest is probably the worst place, which is where my tattoo is, so it hurt. <EOS>
<BOS> Because there's not much meat there, kind of, because there is a lot of bone. And, the closer to the bone it is, and the thinner the skin the more painful it's going to be. <EOS>
<BOS> Alright <EOS>
<BOS> I want to go to Thailand. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I love that country. The people, the food and the culture. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I guess from Narita Airport. <EOS>
<BOS> Approximately 7 hours I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> I would eat Thai food which is something like Pat Thai, which is a Thai noodle, or Tom Yang Gung, which is a Thai soup. <EOS>
<BOS> It's spicy.  <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I can. <EOS>
<BOS> As long as I don't get fired. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> The beach. It's cold here. It's getting warm but I like warm weather. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, another beach person. <EOS>
<BOS> I love the beach. The beach is great. <EOS>
<BOS> It's nice fresh air, beautiful water, you can play in the sand, and my hobby is surfing, so I like to go surfing. <EOS>
<BOS> I try to go as often as possible, usually every weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Usually early on a Saturday morning. Try to beat the crowds. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, just relax on the sand, watch the people, maybe have a swim, throw a frisbee. <EOS>
<BOS> Since I was ten years old. <EOS>
<BOS> A towel, and my hat, my sunscreen, my surfboard, wetsuit, some food and water, and maybe a radio. <EOS>
<BOS> The beaches are much bigger and white sand, clean water, very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Catch you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yep. <EOS>
<BOS> It's, I'm working for Tsukigi Fish Market, which is quite big and it's of course the two place, which is inside and outside. I work for outside.  <EOS>
<BOS> Normally sell the fish. It's the main job. But I also have to carry fish,  and you know, um carrying ice and put, put ice, um, yeah, and preserve fish. <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Thanks a lot Jeanna. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hear you, so you say permit, is that the same thing as a license? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. How do you get a permit? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is the DMV? <EOS>

<BOS> A big house. Really!  <EOS>
<BOS> Jeez! 12 rooms. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. OK. I guess. well that's old for America, but that's probably not very old. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. OK. What is in your kitchen? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And what is in the living room? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you watch TV a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, wow, that's the only thing I like is sports <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. OK. Great. Thanks.  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, sounds like a good place. <EOS>

<BOS> You've retired. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you watch soccer on TV? <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Nice. An..and what is you favorite soccer team? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great. All right. Thanks a lot.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to barbecue outside on the grill. <EOS>
<BOS> When I cook meat, I don't put much, only salt, pepper, and a little bit of seasoning. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't think I'm a good dancer and I don't really try to be a good dancer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't like to dance. <EOS>
<BOS> Right. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to learn how to line dance, and I do like country music but I haven't been officially taught how to line dance. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not a good singer but I do enjoy going to Karaoke. <EOS>
<BOS> In Hawaii, when I go to Karaoke I enjoy singing Hawaiian music. If I'm in Japan I like to sing other English songs that they have, usually country music or 80's or 90's music. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know if I'm a good student. Growing up I was not a good student but now I am trying harder to be a good student. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't enjoy going to school and I didn't try very hard in school. Now I try a little harder. I make an effort.  <EOS>
<BOS> I try to listen to the teachers now instead of doing my own thing, and I try to complete everything with good quality. <EOS>
<BOS> Growing up I was a good athlete. I played a few sports. Now I don't play any sports anymore because I'm old, but growing up I think I was a good athlete. <EOS>
<BOS> I played American football, baseball, and soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> I would say football. American football is my best sport. <EOS>
<BOS> I played since I was eleven until age twenty-two. <EOS>
<BOS> I played at the University of Hawaii. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. Now, you grew up in Southern California. What was it like growing up on the beach in the summer? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you learn how to surf? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. Even in winter it's too cold, the water. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, where would this house be? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Would yo buy a house in the city or the country? <EOS>
<BOS> So, it'd be in Japan.? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, would you have animals at this house? <EOS>
<BOS> Really. No dog? <EOS>
<BOS> You got to have a dog, man. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a driver's license? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So, how long have you had your driver's license?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How do you get a driver's license in your country?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Did you get a perfect score on your driving test? <EOS>
<BOS> Do all the members of your family drive?  <EOS>
<BOS> So, what did you study in high school?  <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. Well, that's kind of similar. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, what did you do in high school? Any clubs or anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, you're quite athletic. What sport did you like the most? <EOS>
<BOS> Really! <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think you'll pick it up some time in the future? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! Not too many lakes in Tokyo. Um, anything esle? Any other memories about high school? <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like a good time. <EOS>
<BOS> And who is the best player in the world? Cricket player? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, and he's from India?  <EOS>
<BOS> OK, is he from the south of India or? <EOS>
<BOS> He's from north India. And he's a very good batter? <EOS>
<BOS> Batsman <EOS>
<BOS> How many times do you get to try to hit the ball? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really but you only get one time. Like in baseball you bat and another person bats <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really,  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow and do you play cricket with your friends? <EOS>
<BOS> You said this guys name, what's it, I'm sorry? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I don't know him. See I like baseball. Do you know who Barry Bonds is? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that's OK. You teach me about cricket and I'll teach you about baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> We start school at 8 <EOS>
<BOS> We go back. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, because in Mongolia we have two parts. In the morning, the high school students go to the school and from 1 <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> In Mongolia, the mother and father they usually work and when I finish my school I just go back and make my own food, because in Mongolia mothers work is not to, like, stay at home or do housework. Kids are taught to clean up the home and cook their food and wash their clothes and that's your work and usually the mothers don't do that kind of thing.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> It really depends on the school but for me, like, I was studying in an international school so I had to study quite hard to get the level still. So for me, I studied after school...I'd rather study at night, so I studied like 3 or 4 hours at night. So that's my study habit.  <EOS>
<BOS> Not really compared to other students.  <EOS>
<BOS> So can you tell me more about the weather? It's always sunny? It never rains? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. Can you tell me more about the beach?  <EOS>
<BOS> Can you tell me maybe about the nature in Hawaii? <EOS>
<BOS> What's a wallaby? <EOS>
<BOS> What do they look like?  <EOS>
<BOS> Interesting. Any other interesting animals in Hawaii? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any animals that live in the sea?  <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any whales?  <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, there are a lot of animals that live in Hawaii. Sounds like a great place to visit.  <EOS>
<BOS> I like to know what's going on in the world, so I usually watch CNN or BBC. <EOS>
<BOS> Usually, yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't go to the movies very often, maybe twice a year, I would say. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I rent movies more than I go to the cinema, but also not very often. <EOS>
<BOS> I like funny movies. Comedies. <EOS>
<BOS> I watched Home Alone last night but it was on TV. I didn't rent the movie. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like reading, so I don't read books very often. The only time I do read books is for school purposes. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, my major is International Relations, so usually I read International Relations books, if I have to read. <EOS>
<BOS> Not for entertainment. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I try to watch the movies on the airplane. <EOS>
<BOS> I go to concerts once in awhile. In Hawaii, there aren't many concerts so when they're are concerts, I try to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I like Hawaiian music so I go to Hawaiian concerts, and if a big star from America comes, I usually try to go also. <EOS>
<BOS> Right, music concerts. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you read a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Ah, you're the man. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, how many books do you get through a week? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's pretty good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hear you. It rots your mind, I think. Ah, also, what kind of books you like to read? What kind of genres? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool, so actually, when you read, like where do you normally read? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool. I love to read on the trains.  <EOS>
<BOS> Must be pretty competitive. <EOS>
<BOS> How about when you were a child, what was your dream job? Did you want to be a diplomat when you were say, 10? <EOS>
<BOS> I wanted to be a baseball player. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm still dreaming. <EOS>
<BOS> Traditional Hawaiian food is usually cooked under the ground in a hole with hot rocks and it cooks for maybe six hours or seven hours and when you take it out, it's very salty because we use a lot of salt and it tastes really good ... usually meat ... usually pork and other vegetables like taro and potato.  <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite Hawaiian dish is called Lao-Lao. It's pork or fish wrapped in leaves and put inside the underground oven and it's very salty and very good. <EOS>
<BOS> The flavor is salt and also the leaf flavor that it's wrapped in. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite dessert has to be cake and ice-cream together. I love to eat cake and ice-cream together. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite ice-cream flavor is strawberry, and I like to eat that with chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> Not so much. I don't like to eat vegetables but I can eat them if somebody cooks them for me. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite vegetable ... I don't have a favorite vegetable but I can eat vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, carrots. Those types of things. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer them cooked. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you usually get home at night? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How do you go home? Do you drive or take the train? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And when do you go to bed? <EOS>
<BOS> At midnight. That's pretty late. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you wake up the next day? <EOS>
<BOS> Man, you're a strong guy! Um..how often do you look at the stars? <EOS>
<BOS> The moon. OK! Can you see the stars from your house? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And do you prefer the morning or the evening? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, me, too. I'm the same. Last question, can you stay up all night? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Yeah, me too. All right, thanks Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. So what is Manicotti?  <EOS>
<BOS> So how do you make it? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds really good. How often do you make manicotti? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the secret to good manicotti? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Well I'll remember that. Thanks a lot Jessica. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, because in the fall we have a celebration called Naadam and that's the best time to go. And you get to see horse racing and archery and wrestling and so many tourist come to Mongolia at that time.  <EOS>
<BOS> Well I would say khuushuur.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Everyone loves it. And for me, I love it too. It looks like dumpling but fried and it's more bigger and inside is meat.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> It's a flour, yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes <EOS>
<BOS> Beef.  <EOS>
<BOS> We don't really eat chicken and we don't eat fish. Well, we have a river fish. It's like really delicious but then we don't have sea so seafood is not popular at all.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  <EOS>
<BOS> Probably, it's better to go to the countryside because if you go to Ulan Bator it's just the same as other cities around the world. But the countryside is a whole different world. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, in the department stores they have sections for Mongolian traditional gifts and stuff so probably you can get the tent -- a small tent. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, and then if you open the door you can actually see all the furniture is inside it. So it's kind of interesting.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you read usually? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What are you reading now? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, OK. It looks like a pretty good book. What is it about? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you read? When do you find time to read? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is your favorite author? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. it's kind of hard to pick. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, why is that? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What is your least favorite season? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What season are we in right now? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the weather like today? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, which one do you prefer? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you like to take photos of? <EOS>
<BOS> Now you mean your family or strangers? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, OK. Do you mind being photographed? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you smile when people take your picture? <EOS>
<BOS> A silly face! OK. Um..what kind of pictures do you like to look at? <EOS>
<BOS> Cityscapes! <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great! And do you have pictures of yourself as a child? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Do you have any pictures of your family in your wallet? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, Wow! Wow, that's nice! OK. Thanks, Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> Sophie Wilkins. Sophie, where are you from? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, nice. Adelaide. What's Adelaide like? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Is it like over a million people or? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's pretty big. Nice. How long have you lived there? <EOS>
<BOS> Six years! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, nice. Farmer girl.  <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great, so after Japan are you going to go back to Australia? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Great. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> OK, the first thing is you can go and see the ancient things that all the Kings and Queens built, like castles. We have a castle called... it's called the Rock Castle. It's called Sigirya, so it's very beautiful. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's... the castle is on the rock itself, so you can see the ruins there. It's really beautiful, with pictures, paintings, arts and stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure, but maybe around two thousand. I'm not sure. Sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> The second thing should be beaches. We have beautiful beaches all over the place, blue, clean. You can swim. You can surf. It's very beautiful. That's the second thing. <EOS>
<BOS> M-hm. I mean, not popular amongst Sri Lankans but most of the... many tourists come, especially the Germans, they come to my country and surf because the hotels near the beaches are very cheap and it's very beautiful hotels and very cheap. Food is cheap. It's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> And then a third thing should be the Tooth Temple. It's like the tooth of a Buddha, so we got it from I guess India, King Ashoka, so it's one of the things that you can see there. It's a really beautiful temple. <EOS>
<BOS> Temple of Tooth Relic. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, really. OK. What radio station? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. And what internet websites do you listen to? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. How much of the news do you think is true? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. How do most people in your country get the news? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks Keri. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's wonderful. So how many of your family member will be there? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What kind of bread do you eat? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you like to put on bread? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. But not together? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like mustard? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I love mustard. I eat mustard and bread just plain. <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Can you make bread? <EOS>

<BOS> What's the reasoning behind the tattoo? Why did you get it? <EOS>
<BOS> So, you drew the tattoo. <EOS>
<BOS> Did it hurt when it was being sketched in your body? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is the chest the worst place? <EOS>
<BOS> Thailand. Why Thailand? <EOS>

<BOS> OK. Why do you love the beach? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh..nice. How often do you go surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. When do you go to the beach? Saturday? Sunday? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. What do you do at the beach besides surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been surfing? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, since you were ten. That's great! -- What do you take to the beach, when you go? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Now, you are from Australia. How are the beaches  different in Australia than Japan? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Well, sounds good. Thanks a lot Trevor. <EOS>
<BOS> Outside? <EOS>
<BOS> OK, well what do you do everyday at the fish market? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, what time do you start work? <EOS>
<BOS> 4 <EOS>
<BOS> OK. Thanks, Daisuke. <EOS>
<BOS> Cookies and brownies and cake. <EOS>
<BOS> I am terrible at singing. I don't like going to karaoke and I don't like to sing. I like music, but I can't sing for my life. I, yesterday, or I guess in class it was a students birthday and I made my students sing Happy Birthday but they wouldn't start so I had to start them off singing and my voice was so bad, they started laughing at me, so I'm just a terrible singer. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not a good dancer. I can't dance at all. I used to when I was younger, my parents would enroll me in ballet classes, so I did ballet for six years but I am not very good at dancing. <EOS>
<BOS> I was a good student because I'm a dork. No, yeah, I think I was a good student. I tried hard in all of my classes. I always did my homework. I was always focused and took notes during class. If I didn't understand something, I would either ask questions in class or speak to the teacher or professor after class.  <EOS>
<BOS> That's a tricky question. I like sports, and I like playing sports. I don't think I'm a very good athlete, probably compared to you, I'm probably not, but I really enjoy playing sports. In high school, I played soccer. I ran cross-country. I played ice-hockey and a little bit of lacrosse. <EOS>
<BOS> My favorite sport was ice-hockey. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to mail this package to Italy. <EOS>
<BOS> Some toys and baby clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> I have it here. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. When will my package arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> I would like your fastest shipping. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> With my credit card. <EOS>
<BOS> No. That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> You too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> My son was in an auto accident last night. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago. <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Alice. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Transmission problems can be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you afford a new car? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car. <EOS>
<BOS> This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice to hear. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a toothache. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! 4 pm is perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ok. I will be there at 3 <EOS>
<BOS> Bye. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join me? <EOS>
<BOS> ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market. <EOS>
<BOS> You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you have any? <EOS>
<BOS> They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I can wait for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work. <EOS>
<BOS> I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am. I work out for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, how about lifting weights? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about aerobics? <EOS>
<BOS> Yoga? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market. <EOS>
<BOS> The one down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I always go to that market. <EOS>
<BOS> It's always so crowded there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I still like the smaller store. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been waiting? <EOS>
<BOS> That's 30 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> There are still several people ahead of us. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later. <EOS>
<BOS> Bye Kevin. <EOS>
<BOS> There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I hope no one was seriously injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I didn't see it happen. <EOS>
<BOS> After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving. <EOS>
<BOS> We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Peter. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Does your younger son loan him money? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny and smart. He's like a bank. <EOS>
<BOS> This is giving him great experience. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but the line is usually very long. <EOS>
<BOS> Overseas to Korea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think the line will be long today? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go have lunch instead? <EOS>
<BOS> Why Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to go. <EOS>
<BOS> But it hurt last time. <EOS>
<BOS> But I brush my teeth every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I don't have any cavities this time. <EOS>
<BOS> What time are you picking me up? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll tell my teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work. <EOS>
<BOS> Three? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. What about riding your bike to work? <EOS>
<BOS> You can carpool with someone. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work with anyone who lives near you? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you want to ride with your boss? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal to be nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to get him a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Did your auto insurance go up a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> When will that be? <EOS>
<BOS> Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of procedure? <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That should help. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's important to have dental insurance. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. <EOS>
<BOS> To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They are all overdue. <EOS>
<BOS> We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room. <EOS>
<BOS> About two months. <EOS>
<BOS> I found the notices in his room too. <EOS>
<BOS> He said he couldn't find them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is. <EOS>
<BOS> Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm learning that now. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> The mechanic is my brother-in-law. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car? <EOS>
<BOS> At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper. <EOS>
<BOS> It's supposed to be ready this afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent. <EOS>
<BOS> They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a few minutes before they close. <EOS>
<BOS> They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school? <EOS>
<BOS> I like pretzels and potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I go to the market with you? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to take break. I've been studying all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we get ice cream on the way home? <EOS>
<BOS> I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test. <EOS>
<BOS> What is in the package? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any breakables? Is it fragile? <EOS>
<BOS> Please fill out this form. Print clearly. Sometimes, it is hard to read. <EOS>
<BOS> It depends on your shipping choice. <EOS>
<BOS> It will be there in one week. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the cost. How would you like to pay? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Is there anything else I can help you with today? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you. Have a nice day. <EOS>
<BOS> Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! <EOS>
<BOS> How scary for him. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible! <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think he will go to jail? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I help you with anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he close to us? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I would have to buy a used car. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking. <EOS>
<BOS> Will this be your first visit? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything wrong with your teeth? <EOS>
<BOS> We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. We'll see you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too. But my car is at the repair shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing serious. Just an oil change. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Which one are you going to? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me check my purse and see if I have any coupons too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I use their coupons all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons? <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you leaving? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll be right back. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year. <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you go in the morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am? That's too early. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm asleep at 5 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I hate running. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have the strength to lift weights. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too much jumping around? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one? <EOS>
<BOS> Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> The market is going out of business? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But it has a bigger selection of things. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale. <EOS>
<BOS> I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work. <EOS>
<BOS> I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use it for my business. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been here since 8 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. It's been a long wait. <EOS>
<BOS> Many people left. They were tired of waiting. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. See you another time. <EOS>
<BOS> Was anyone hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident? <EOS>
<BOS> You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> That was smart. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! <EOS>
<BOS> I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but he adds on interest. <EOS>
<BOS> He wants to be a banker one day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need to go to the post office? <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you sending your package? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a big package? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. Today is Monday. Most people go on Monday since the post office is closed on Sunday. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's a better idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a dentist appointment. <EOS>
<BOS> It's just a check-up. <EOS>
<BOS> That is because you had a cavity. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but you eat too much candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> 2 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> I will also call the school office. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my boss. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas. <EOS>
<BOS> He's a little nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school. <EOS>
<BOS> No, he has to share with my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Our insurance rate doubled. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive. <EOS>
<BOS> In two years. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like the part-time job idea better. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm here for a procedure. <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected. <EOS>
<BOS> A little. I took some medicine this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't think it was important. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> Under his bed? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you find them? <EOS>
<BOS> How late are they? <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you receive notices before? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't he return them? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he in trouble? <EOS>
<BOS> That's five weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Again? What's wrong with it this time? <EOS>
<BOS> That's weird. It's not even an old car. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't know? What is he doing then? <EOS>
<BOS> You should take it to another mechanic. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't sound very trustworthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe too cheap isn't always better. <EOS>
<BOS> You should demand a refund. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is it complicated? <EOS>
<BOS> Where is your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you ok? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. When do you get your car back? <EOS>
<BOS> That's quick. <EOS>
<BOS> Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced? <EOS>
<BOS> I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That's good to know. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll check it out tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close? <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you usually get there? <EOS>
<BOS> What happens if you're late? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you ever been late? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Is your boss understanding? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What kind of snacks? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will pick up some fruits too. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruits are healthy for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with your homework? <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should stay home and study. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We will only be gone for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you needed to study. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a problem? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I promise to keep the apartment clean. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  How do you want to divide it? <EOS>
<BOS> What are the common areas? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds fair. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Was it high? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's the air conditioner. <EOS>
<BOS> But it's so hot these days. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> 4 AM?  That's rude. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you complain? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have proof? <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you think she's dating someone else? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't follow your hunch.  Get proof. <EOS>
<BOS> I hurt my back. <EOS>
<BOS> Yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I was trying to get out of helping.   <EOS>
<BOS> No, I can't.  I have to finish my homework. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I have a math test tomorrow too. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could go, but I'm so behind in my classes. <EOS>
<BOS> I was sick for a few days and missed several classes. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I just need to focus on my school work. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't have time. I have a big test today at 1 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'll grab something on the way to class. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'll grab a burger. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. But I don't have time. <EOS>
<BOS> I like fast food meals anyway. They're quick and easy. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, please. I'm in college now. I can cut my own fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll take this banana. It's quick and easy. See you later, Mom. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sharon. Today we are doing our annual spring cleaning. <EOS>
<BOS> It's the day we thoroughly clean the whole house. We throw away things we don't need, pack up things to donate, clean all of the rooms, and wash all of the windows. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It takes all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. They look through their closets and toy bins to find clothes and toys to donate or throw away. <EOS>
<BOS> Because it's done in the spring season. <EOS>
<BOS> After we have the things ready for donation, Jim takes them to the local homeless shelter. This makes the house easier to clean. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I better get started. I have a lot to do. Talk to you later, Sharon. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I did not. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you calling me a liar? <EOS>
<BOS> You have no proof. <EOS>
<BOS> When do you need it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That is a big stain. <EOS>
<BOS> You have been a good customer for many years.  I will do it for no extra charge. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you, too.  It will be ready by 4 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> What did you say? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not a very good answer. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you had plans to go back to school and get a degree. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you wanted a degree so you can apply for better paying positions in the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Then why didn't you tell her these things? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a problem? <EOS>
<BOS> I thought Greg was doing that. <EOS>
<BOS> He didn't mention that to me. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I just got an urgent email.  I need to reply immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be busy meeting clients all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mary. Yeah, our favorite place is the pancake house on Main Street. <EOS>
<BOS> We love it. Kids eat free on their birthdays too. <EOS>
<BOS> They love the chocolate chip pancakes. <EOS>
<BOS> I like their waffles. They're thick and fluffy. They put fresh strawberries over them. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't on Saturday. Joanne has a soccer game in the morning. What about Sunday? <EOS>
<BOS> 10 am is good for us too. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds wonderful. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  She's on maternity leave right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Three months. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  She's sad about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.   <EOS>
<BOS> Katherine wants to take an extra month of maternity leave. <EOS>
<BOS> How many have you had? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Your mother makes the best cookies. <EOS>
<BOS> You might get a tummy ache.  <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you wait until after dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Be confident.  You can do it.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know we do, but don't let him know how much we need it. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't ever let him see you sweat.  That will make him think you're nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't need to know that! <EOS>
<BOS> He is a good actor, but he is not very popular. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is he underrated? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think that is true.  There are many popular actors who are not handsome. <EOS>
<BOS> He is very good at playing an evil guy. <EOS>
<BOS> But he needs to play other types of roles. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it?   <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  I thought I was doing a good job. <EOS>
<BOS> This is terrible.  I just bought a home. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been busy.  I'll finish it tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I just work slowly. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want me to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool. <EOS>
<BOS> I love art. I paint in my spare time. <EOS>
<BOS> Sculpting? That's fascinating. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't. I already have plans. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I would love to. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know that much about it. I just really enjoy looking at it. <EOS>
<BOS> You're a good friend. What is your interest? <EOS>
<BOS> I love music too. But painting is my passion. <EOS>
<BOS> I can show you some right now. I have them on my wall. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  It's not appropriate for work. <EOS>
<BOS> Whose attention? <EOS>
<BOS> He's married! <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jane. No, this is a rental car. I was in an auto accident yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I went there this morning. The doctor took some did x-rays. Nothing is serious. I just have some bruises. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the other driver rear-ended me at a red light. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He seemed ok at the scene. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. We were both lucky. <EOS>
<BOS> No. It's too damaged to be repaired. It's at the junkyard now. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I loved that car. It protected me in this accident. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to the electronics store with my son. <EOS>
<BOS> No. My son has been saving money to buy a tablet. They're so expensive, so I told him I would pay for half of it. <EOS>
<BOS> His birthday is next week, so this is his birthday present. <EOS>
<BOS> I already have one. My son really likes it. So, he wants one of his own. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. My son keeps taking mine. I'm tired of sharing it with him all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Do you have one? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with the report? <EOS>
<BOS> That's why I haven't seen you. <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you have so many meetings? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it that time of the year? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right.  It's almost 4 PM.  You'd better go. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Did anyone get hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky you don't work there anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Did they evacuate the area? <EOS>
<BOS> I should call my friend.  She lives a couple of blocks from there. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not that bad. <EOS>
<BOS> I have seen worse hotels.  Stop complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  This place is pretty bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  We got a puppy that year. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  He had a great name. <EOS>
<BOS> How could you forget his name?  His name was Buster. <EOS>
<BOS> I never wanted another dog after that. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't remember anything.  He was 14 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you try to calm him down? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Transfer the customer to me. <EOS>
<BOS> No. My grandfather had a heart attack this morning. I have to go to the hospital with my parents. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, yes. Could you pick up any homework assignments I may miss? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know yet. We're not sure about his condition. <EOS>
<BOS> No. It's a three-hour drive. My mom is packing some clothes just in case she needs to stay at the hospital overnight. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Well, I better go now. I'm going to e-mail our teacher and let him know too. I'll tell him to give any missed assignments to you. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! That would wonderful. <EOS>
<BOS> I will. Talk to you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you get me one too? <EOS>
<BOS> Bottle.  Here's $10.   <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you, Natalie. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you taken a tour of the office yet? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like me to show you around? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's start with my office.  It's at the end of the hallway. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it's a relaxing view in a stressful industry. <EOS>
<BOS> I bought a laptop last week and I'm not happy with it. <EOS>
<BOS> It is very slow. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Can I bring it after work around 6 PM? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you!  This is great after sales service.   <EOS>
<BOS> I will definitely be back for your other products. <EOS>
<BOS> I am in the mood for pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> I found a coupon in the newspaper for free delivery. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  It's raining. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to get him? <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a hobby? <EOS>
<BOS> What about clothes or shoes? <EOS>
<BOS> Jewelry? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I don't know what else to suggest. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. We can grab lunch at the mall. <EOS>
<BOS> When is Phil's birthday? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't go in his office right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe he needs more coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you get off work? <EOS>
<BOS> I have tickets to the symphony. Would you like to go? <EOS>
<BOS> 7 pm. Can you get off work a little early? <EOS>
<BOS> You can come late. I can drop off the ticket at your work. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. Maybe I should ask someone else this time. <EOS>
<BOS> My company gives us concert tickets all the time. Let's try to go next time. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Billy. We're here to buy your cousin a birthday present. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Can you help me find something for your cousin? What does he like? <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's what you like. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's get him that helicopter. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe for your birthday. <EOS>
<BOS> You are a smart boy, Billy. <EOS>
<BOS> She's getting a divorce. <EOS>
<BOS> Sharon told me. <EOS>
<BOS> Sharon is a gossip queen. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> We can't afford to hire another person right now. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand, but my boss won't hire another person. <EOS>
<BOS> But you're my best employee. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me help with the projects. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Isabel.  Is there a problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I haven't signed up yet. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> I will do that today since I have another business trip at the end of the week. <EOS>
<BOS> We do not have any more in red, but I can order one for you. <EOS>
<BOS> It should take 3-5 business days. <EOS>
<BOS> When is your mother's birthday?  <EOS>
<BOS> I will call you when it arrives. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I hope she likes the sweater. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> We only give a refund within 30 days of purchase. <EOS>
<BOS> Is the product broken? <EOS>
<BOS> What did she say about that? <EOS>
<BOS> I will talk to her.  Transfer the call to me. <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is this happening? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  When is the acquisition happening? <EOS>
<BOS> That's soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  That's how my brother lost his job. <EOS>
<BOS> I better start looking for a new job. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Drawing is one of my hobbies. <EOS>
<BOS> I doodle when I'm bored. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What does he need to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not hard at all. When is it due? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, I can come by after dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be lovely. Thank you. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. He will have an awesome castle. <EOS>
<BOS> Cheryl is being arrested. <EOS>
<BOS> Money.  A lot of money. <EOS>
<BOS> Over a million dollars. <EOS>
<BOS> This scandal is going to make the news. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What do you need to buy? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you like your first apartment? Do you like living alone? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> Where do you sit to eat? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you afford to buy a new dining table and chairs? <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't we try a yard sale? I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales. <EOS>
<BOS> Right! We should go today. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe I'll find something too. <EOS>
<BOS> It is $30,000. <EOS>
<BOS> It's in excellent condition with low miles on it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a bit low.   <EOS>
<BOS> I can sell it to you for $28,000. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me talk to my manager. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll be right back. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to have a burger. <EOS>
<BOS> You might get hungry later. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea.  You always get hungry around midnight. <EOS>
<BOS> What is your company recalling? <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary! <EOS>
<BOS> Have there been any deaths? <EOS>
<BOS> Joe and I love to go to Hawaii every summer. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a beautiful and relaxing place. <EOS>
<BOS> There are many places to sightsee. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a lovely condo you could stay in. <EOS>
<BOS> We won't charge you.  You're my best friend. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going skiing with some friends. What about you, Linda? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. Do they live near? <EOS>
<BOS> Does it snow a lot during the winter there? <EOS>
<BOS> Is that where your hometown is? <EOS>
<BOS> You should go skiing with us one day. There's a lot of snow in the mountains during the winter. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know how to ski, but you love snow? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll teach you then. Skiing is fun! <EOS>
<BOS> Winter is the best time for that, too! <EOS>
<BOS> Thank, Carol. I've been working hard on it. <EOS>
<BOS> I water my flowers regularly and I use a good fertilizer. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you using a good fertilizer? <EOS>
<BOS> You're doing all of the right things. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you don't have a green thumb. <EOS>
<BOS> A green thumb means you have good gardening skills. <EOS>
<BOS> My dad used to love gardening. I learned everything from him. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. But I can't guarantee anything. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.   <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Do I drop Kevin off first? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's right.  I forgot.   <EOS>
<BOS> I think they need to take the bus to school. <EOS>
<BOS> Good morning, Sally. <EOS>
<BOS> I did the countdown to New Year's with my family. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> You had to work on New Year's Eve? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you up so early? Do you have to work today, too? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the Rose Bowl? <EOS>
<BOS> We don't watch that much football in our house. <EOS>
<BOS> No. What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> That must be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I will. <EOS>
<BOS> Happy New Year, Sally! <EOS>
<BOS> It was ok, Mom. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. A boy in my class. <EOS>
<BOS> He's cool. His name is Brian. He plays soccer. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I miss my old team with Ted, Mark, and Richard. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. He rides the school bus on our street. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Then I can meet more of the neighborhood kids. <EOS>
<BOS> "Brian said the bus comes at 7 <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'll set my alarm. <EOS>
<BOS> It was great!  The band was amazing!  <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  Both were great. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go together next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Tim. I'm going to the school library. <EOS>
<BOS> My computer isn't working and I need to finish a report. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! My report is due tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with your report? <EOS>
<BOS> I should've worked on it last night too. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I fell asleep. I was so tired. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! Can I buy you coffee? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> I'll try to fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let's call a plumber. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I think it's late today. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Do you? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I think the bus is late today because of the rain. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. The bus is usually several minutes late when it rains. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah and probably because of car accidents. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I think riding the bus on rainy days is better. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I'll see you here at the bus stop. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it was. I think our bus is coming now. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm very sorry that happened. <EOS>
<BOS> Please fill out this lost luggage form. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  I am very sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  We will send it to you right away. <EOS>
<BOS> We will contact you as soon as we locate your suitcase. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love some, Joan. The tomatoes you gave me last time were delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you growing? <EOS>
<BOS> That's amazing! You won't have to buy any more vegetables at the market. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you. You're so generous. <EOS>
<BOS> I will make you more in exchange for the vegetables. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you thought about selling your vegetables at the local farmer's market? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice of you. <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do there? <EOS>
<BOS> How long are you going to be there? <EOS>
<BOS> Did her mom say it was okay? <EOS>
<BOS> If her mom says yes, you may sleep over. <EOS>
<BOS> They're doing well.   <EOS>
<BOS> Mike is 18.  He's in college.  Janet is 16.  She's in high school. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  They're growing up too fast. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of trouble? <EOS>
<BOS> What makes you think that? <EOS>
<BOS> We can't lose our jobs.  I just bought a home. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck! <EOS>
<BOS> Aim high. <EOS>
<BOS> If you expect more from the negotiation, you'll get more. <EOS>
<BOS> If you have low expectations, the outcome may not be satisfying. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, be confident! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm going to Chicago. My sister just had a baby. I'm going to be helping her for a couple of weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> A girl. Her name is Rose. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. She is named after our grandmother. <EOS>
<BOS> That's also a beautiful name. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. This is my first niece too. She's also the first grandchild in the family. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. My mother is so excited. She's only lives a few blocks away from my sister. So, she will be helping a lot too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I agree. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the airport by 1 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. Carol and I are thinking about going out to dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Where? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! Carol and I love Chinese food. <EOS>
<BOS> What made you finally do it? <EOS>
<BOS> When will it be open? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have experience running a restaurant? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> We would love to! We were thinking about going to a Chinese restaurant tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Carol. My daughter has a soccer game at 11 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. She plays in the rain too. <EOS>
<BOS> No, only if there's a storm. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. We love it. She's the goalie. She's really good. <EOS>
<BOS> Seven years. She wants to get a scholarship to college. <EOS>
<BOS> I played a couple of years in high school, but she is much better than I was. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. All the time. But she loves the sport and wants to play. <EOS>
<BOS> That's her dream. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you doing this year? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That's going to be a lot of fun! <EOS>
<BOS> What if no one accepts the invitation? <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Charlie. I'm meeting some friends at the park. We're going to play basketball. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Perfect day to be outside. Do you play basketball? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join us? <EOS>
<BOS> A dentist appointment on a nice day? <EOS>
<BOS> What about next weekend? We get together every Saturday at the basketball court in the park. <EOS>
<BOS> Same time every Saturday. 10 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We could use another player. One guy hurt his knee and won't be able to play for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> Cool! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm looking for a bike for my daughter. <EOS>
<BOS> She is five years old. This will be her first bike. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, her favorite color is purple. <EOS>
<BOS> I really like this one. This has stars on it. She loves stars. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. How much is this bike? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great feature. I think I will buy it. What is your return policy? <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have a cell phone? <EOS>
<BOS> What made you decide to get one now? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, cell phones are very convenient. Do you know what kind you want to get? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want a smartphone? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know what a smartphone is? <EOS>
<BOS> A smartphone is a cell phone that also has computer features. You have e-mail and Internet access. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have an e-mail address? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's amazing! People don't mail letters anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea! Welcome to modern technology, Ruth! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we just got back from the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> David fell at school and broke his arm. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the school called an ambulance and they took him to the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a little. The doctor gave him some pain medication. <EOS>
<BOS> He's so upset though. <EOS>
<BOS> No. His soccer team is playing the championship game this weekend and he's the goalie. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it does. He's been practicing so much for this game. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. He has to go and cheer his team on. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. They were undefeated all season. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I'm Karen.  Nice to meet you, Bill. <EOS>
<BOS> I think we will be working closely together.   <EOS>
<BOS> I will!  My first question is "Where is the restroom?" <EOS>
<BOS> That should be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm busy this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Then maybe I should join you.  I'm terrible at golf. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  That would make me uncomfortable too. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have a choice.  Just be yourself.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but I don't think I made a good first impression. <EOS>
<BOS> I was trying to act too cool.  I don't think they took me seriously. <EOS>
<BOS> I forgot them, so I wrote my contact info on napkins. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  What am I going to do?   <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll attach a thank you note too. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you should ask the boss for some time off? <EOS>
<BOS> Take a break next week after the presentation. <EOS>
<BOS> You need to make a change. You're going to get sick. <EOS>
<BOS> I know you do. But you also have to take care of yourself too. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. He had a heart attack a few years ago. He understands that health is very important. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. Where do you plan to go on vacation? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds great! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Joan. Bill and I are going to a play tonight. My daughter is the lead actress. <EOS>
<BOS> This will be her first performance. She is a drama student in college and she got the lead role. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will. I'm so excited and proud of her. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, she is very nervous. But she loves acting, so this will be a true test for her. <EOS>
<BOS> No. This is something she auditioned for on her own. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. She was shocked. Her drama professor is coming too. <EOS>
<BOS> She's more nervous about her drama professor than the rest of the audience. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but she wants to do well in front of him. <EOS>
<BOS> I like the mountains so we can ski. <EOS>
<BOS> We can go to the beach during the summer and the mountains during the winter. <EOS>
<BOS> The kids will love that. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree.  We didn't get anything done. <EOS>
<BOS> She wouldn't listen to anyone's ideas. <EOS>
<BOS> They're good friends. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  All she does is complain all day. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not going to do anything.  Jim is a naysayer too. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Have you? <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  I heard she was very mean. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard if she doesn't like what you say, she will fire you. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  Our clients haven't sent me anything yet. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm trying to be flexible. <EOS>
<BOS> Be a good listener.  The best way to negotiate is to listen to what the other side says. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Ask him questions.  You can get a lot of information by asking questions. <EOS>
<BOS> Many issues can get resolved if we just learn to listen. <EOS>
<BOS> We're having a BBQ party with some relatives, Billy. <EOS>
<BOS> Hot dogs like we do every year. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Who? <EOS>
<BOS> What is his name? <EOS>
<BOS> What country are they from? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We can ask them this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> He's hanging up the American flag on our front porch. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure, Kevin. What is your assignment? <EOS>
<BOS> What were you thinking about building? <EOS>
<BOS> That should be fun. Any ideas about the materials? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. We have a lot of old boxes. I saved them after we moved here. <EOS>
<BOS> They're in the garage. Help me bring them into the house. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's put them in the living room. It's the biggest room in the house. There's plenty of space to make a mess. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ok. She can help us too. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you design the building and then we can create it. <EOS>
<BOS> It's my pleasure. I'm an architect. Building is my specialty. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm inviting a couple of friends to sleep over. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. We were going to rent a movie and order pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> Can your parents find another babysitter? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. What time will your parents be back? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to come over after you finish babysitting? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! It's a sleepover party. We're all going to sleep late. <EOS>
<BOS> I will. See you tomorrow night. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Ted. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. When? <EOS>
<BOS> Who else is coming? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the occasion? <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds like fun. What can I bring? <EOS>
<BOS> I can do that. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds delicious! <EOS>
<BOS> This is going to be a great party. <EOS>
<BOS> If it doesn't, we can order pizza! <EOS>
<BOS> I like hamburgers better. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe your expectations are too high. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to fire him? <EOS>
<BOS> What if he doesn't? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  He had great expectations about this job. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you need to see the doctor for? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  The doctor's next available appointment is next Monday at 10 AM. <EOS>
<BOS> Please bring your insurance card and photo ID. <EOS>
<BOS> No.   <EOS>
<BOS> I don't follow the news. <EOS>
<BOS> If it's important, I'll hear people talking about it. <EOS>
<BOS> The news is too scary. <EOS>
<BOS> They only talk about bad things like crime, accidents, and earthquakes. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Is there something you want to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything else we need to bring? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains. <EOS>
<BOS> What is wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> I will take a look at it.   <EOS>
<BOS> It depends on what needs to be repaired.   <EOS>
<BOS> No.  There is no charge to find out what is wrong.  We only charge for repairs. <EOS>
<BOS> Please come back in two hours. <EOS>
<BOS> The newspaper accidentally put the wrong number in someone's ad.   <EOS>
<BOS> An ad for a pizza place. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you tell them we deliver? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What is it, Sean? Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? That's silly. <EOS>
<BOS> That's the best part. We are finally adults. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I'm excited to work and plan my future. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you are acting a little immature. It's time to grow up, Sean. <EOS>
<BOS> You sound lazy. You're a really smart guy. You're going to have a great life. <EOS>
<BOS> You are being silly. If you are so scared of leaving school, why don't you go to graduate school? <EOS>
<BOS> It actually is. You'll get a better job with a graduate degree. <EOS>
<BOS> I did not.  That was my idea. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't remember that. <EOS>
<BOS> It's too late.  I already presented the idea to the manager. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have any proof. <EOS>
<BOS> You are very sneaky. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Bill got lost the other day looking for the restroom. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  The layout looks like a maze. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I have to work overtime tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I did.  But my boss wants me to finish this report. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  My wife is not happy. <EOS>
<BOS> He won't care.  Business is more important to him. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what my wife said too. <EOS>
<BOS> He was rude to Tom. <EOS>
<BOS> He said mean things to Tom. <EOS>
<BOS> John didn't have to be so honest. <EOS>
<BOS> Sometimes the truth is painful. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't understand why you are on John's side. <EOS>
<BOS> No, thank you.  I already have plans. <EOS>
<BOS> I have plans next Saturday too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mark. Our dog, Rusty, is lost. Someone left the backyard gate open and he got out. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. My daughter is so upset right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, they haven't seen him. They said they would call me if they find our dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He's wearing his dog tag and he's also microchipped. <EOS>
<BOS> My wife is doing that right now. <EOS>
<BOS> He's four years old and he's brown with white spots. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's right. I'm not thinking straight. I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he's a big part of our family. We got him when he was a little puppy. <EOS>
<BOS> Rusty! Come here, boy! <EOS>
<BOS> I don't bring my work home. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't do more than you can handle.   <EOS>
<BOS> Then I stay at the office and finish it.  When I go home, I focus on home only. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll let our team know. <EOS>
<BOS> I have two dogs.  They're the best.   <EOS>
<BOS> That's great news! <EOS>
<BOS> That makes me very happy. <EOS>
<BOS> We've never had bonuses. <EOS>
<BOS> If the company is doing well financially, we should definitely receive some benefits. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's celebrate over drinks after work.   <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of place? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to do there? <EOS>
<BOS> What are meadows? <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you want to take pictures? <EOS>
<BOS> Happy Birthday, Gina. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sue. No, they don't. It's President's Day. <EOS>
<BOS> It's an American holiday. It's a day where we honor the United States former presidents. <EOS>
<BOS> We used to celebrate our first president, George Washington's birthday and our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln's birthday. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. But in the 1970's, a law was passed that all presidents would be honored on one day in February. It became a national holiday. <EOS>
<BOS> We celebrate it on the third Monday in February. <EOS>
<BOS> Some businesses like post offices and banks will be closed. But not all businesses close. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, typically they do. <EOS>
<BOS> I used to be a history teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Good.  I'm getting to know a lot of people in the office. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I had to call him about my computer. <EOS>
<BOS> Good to know! <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Jane mentioned that too. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks!   <EOS>
<BOS> Our next available appointment is today at 3 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> How about tomorrow at 5 <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I will send you a reminder tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Dan. Steaks sound delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we invite some friends? <EOS>
<BOS> How about Sandy and Linda. <EOS>
<BOS> What is a vegetarian? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. Maybe we should invite someone else. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's invite Sandy and Susie. <EOS>
<BOS> How about potatoes and salad. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Dan, why aren't you leaving? What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> We can still barbeque. We have a covered backyard. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so too. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the book? <EOS>
<BOS> How about a classic like Moby Dick? <EOS>
<BOS> Herman Melville.   <EOS>
<BOS> I can lend it to you. <EOS>
<BOS> I have many other books.  You can come by and see what I have. <EOS>
<BOS> A typhoon hit China this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I've been trying to call my grandmother. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  All the phone lines are down. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of dog? Yours? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? You love Buster. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so sorry to hear that. You and Charlie have had Buster since he was a puppy. I remember when all three of you moved in next door. <EOS>
<BOS> How about your relatives? Are there any family members that could take Buster? Then you can still see him whenever you want. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, our kids are all grown up and living on their own. Stan and I get lonely sometimes. Would you like us to adopt Buster? <EOS>
<BOS> Stan and I really like Buster. He's housetrained and well-behaved. He rarely barks too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, he'll say yes. He's been talking about getting a dog lately. He'll be happy it's Buster. <EOS>
<BOS> You can come see him anytime. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  There have been a lot of burglaries these days. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have an alarm system? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I feel safer with it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I think I'm busy. <EOS>
<BOS> I just remembered I need to visit my grandmother. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I am not visiting my grandmother. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to help you move. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Barbara. I think I did well. It was pretty easy. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should get a tutor. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I had a tutor last year and she helped me a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, she doesn't live in this state anymore. She moved away for college. <EOS>
<BOS> I can ask my mom. She knows a couple of local college students. <EOS>
<BOS> Until then, I can try to help you too. I like math. It's my favorite subject. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to work on our homework together? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's meet after school in front of the cafeteria. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Are you unhappy here? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That's great.  Can you tell me about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'm free at noon. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds good.  How about Tuesday at 11 AM? <EOS>
<BOS> How about a lunch meeting? <EOS>
<BOS> We can negotiate our business contract then. <EOS>
<BOS> What's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he dangerous? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm scared. <EOS>
<BOS> Your dad's co-workers are throwing him a surprise retirement party. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I was hoping you and Phil could attend. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. But remember it's a surprise. So, don't tell him. <EOS>
<BOS> No. He is actually looking forward to it. He has worked a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> He was a great employee. They're going to miss him at the office. <EOS>
<BOS> I think we're going to take a trip to Hawaii. <EOS>
<BOS> It sure is. We even talked about retiring there. <EOS>
<BOS> You and your family could vacation in Hawaii. You'll have a free place to stay. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's the only bad thing. <EOS>
<BOS> No. What did he catch? How big was it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I've been here all day and have caught nothing. Have you caught anything? <EOS>
<BOS> That's better than me. I just want to give up and go home. <EOS>
<BOS> My wife told me to bring home dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. It was nice today. Hey, can you hold my fishing pole? I need to go to the restroom. <EOS>
<BOS> Steve, what? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a huge salmon! <EOS>
<BOS> Now I can take home dinner. Want to come over and have salmon with us? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. How old is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's probably time to replace it. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds? <EOS>
<BOS> When? I have to work today. Can you wait until tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Let's meet at your place at 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> My brother just bought a brand new computer too. I can ask him if he likes it. <EOS>
<BOS> See you tomorrow around 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> You always forget your wallet. <EOS>
<BOS> How much do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  You haven't paid me back yet. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you don't forget to pay me back. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to believe it.  I love coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you say that? <EOS>
<BOS> It tastes better that way. <EOS>
<BOS> It's too bitter. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm still going to believe it. <EOS>
<BOS> Haven't you been on a business trip before? <EOS>
<BOS> You should bring your laptop, cell phone, and chargers. <EOS>
<BOS> Bring a carry-on bag only, so you don't have to wait for your luggage. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Diane.  I'm Cody Smith.  Nice to meet you. <EOS>
<BOS> I will.  I don't have any questions right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I'm sure I will have lots of questions soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> That's where I'm going too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know! Are you going to work? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it the new Thai place? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> It's pretty good. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Everything is freshly made. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you like it. <EOS>
<BOS> Work. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a chef at the new Thai restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> Let the chef know what you think later. If you liked it, you may get a free dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> You have high expectations. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot of pressure for him. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope he meets your expectations. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sue. <EOS>
<BOS> It's an American holiday that's celebrated once a year. <EOS>
<BOS> There is no actual date. It is different every year. It is on the fourth Thursday in November. <EOS>
<BOS> It first started many years ago after the pilgrims settled in America. They wanted to celebrate the first harvest after settling in America. <EOS>
<BOS> We typically roast a whole turkey and make lots of other dishes like potatoes and stuffing. <EOS>
<BOS> We invite our relatives and celebrate this day together. <EOS>
<BOS> It is! And, pumpkin pie is usually the dessert because pumpkins are in season in the Fall. <EOS>
<BOS> Nowadays, many people celebrate this day to give thanks for all of their blessings like family and good health. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I would love to. I have many great recipes I can share with you. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> So what? <EOS>
<BOS> Then tell jokes.  I heard he likes funny people. <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean for the bank? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good for us.  We need customers. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess we will all have to wait too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, Peter. I have a big project I'm working on. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well. We keep running into problems with the client. <EOS>
<BOS> The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind. It's very frustrating. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. So, my group has to start over each time. It's such a waste of time and money. <EOS>
<BOS> In two weeks. I don't know how we're going to make it. <EOS>
<BOS> They went to eat. I told them to go. They're going to bring me back some dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Go on a long vacation. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I better get back to work. See you in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  The president of the company doesn't care how you dress. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  He only cares about the quality of your work. <EOS>
<BOS> Even on Fridays? <EOS>
<BOS> Was that uncomfortable? <EOS>
<BOS> I know! <EOS>
<BOS> What did the doctor say? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good.  Did he put you on medication? <EOS>
<BOS> We need to stay healthy at this age. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Alice. I'm going to the market later. My husband's boss and his wife are coming over for dinner tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. His wife is a vegetarian, so I need to make one dish without meat. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great. I'm a little nervous about hosting dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never cooked for Jeff's boss before. I want to make sure everything is perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll make sure to use a timer. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I will make lasagna. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! I'll go the market after you talk to her. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Joan. Yeah, I was thinking about checking it out. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm jealous. My set is really old. It takes a long time to wash and dry. <EOS>
<BOS> How can it save me money? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Maybe it's time for an upgrade. <EOS>
<BOS> That would great! Maybe it will be on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn't buy it on sale? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not jealous anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?   <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of car do you want? <EOS>
<BOS> A sports car would be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Who are we giving rides to? <EOS>
<BOS> We're not their chauffeurs. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What time? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I need to call my wife and tell her I will be home late. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you celebrating something? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great news!   <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I will text you after I speak with my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I have two reports due on Monday. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  My boss just gave me another report to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'll be working all week and on the weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> It's ok.  I'm going on a vacation after I'm done. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be gone for one week and turning my cell phone off. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a surprise for you, Timothy. <EOS>
<BOS> Here. Open it. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you tell by the shape? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, open it up and find out. <EOS>
<BOS> Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you. <EOS>
<BOS> You also need a life jacket. <EOS>
<BOS> Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait. <EOS>
<BOS> Things that will attract the fish to the hook. <EOS>
<BOS> Exactly! <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> What are the cookies for? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe that will work. <EOS>
<BOS> They are always busy. <EOS>
<BOS> Many celebrities come here, so everyone wants to come too. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree.  This place is very overrated. <EOS>
<BOS> It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times. <EOS>
<BOS> We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot. <EOS>
<BOS> They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room. <EOS>
<BOS> Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. It'll be free. <EOS>
<BOS> My dad works at the arena. He was able to get front row seats. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Do you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. My dad can pick you up. We're going to leave at 4 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> 7 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> We want to have dinner first. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so excited! <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I would invite you. You're my best friend. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not at all. Actually, I have some good news. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm having a baby. <EOS>
<BOS> Last night. It was too late to call you. I thought you might be sleeping. <EOS>
<BOS> He's so happy. He went out this morning to buy the baby a gift? <EOS>
<BOS> In June. I am 3 months pregnant. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a little. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm actually really hungry right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, let's go out for breakfast. I'll treat you. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, Mom. See you at 8 am. <EOS>
<BOS> There are no direct flights tonight.  There are only non-direct flights. <EOS>
<BOS> There is one layover in San Francisco for an hour.   <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need a ride to the airport? <EOS>
<BOS> 5% of the total order amount. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me talk to my manager.   <EOS>
<BOS> No.  He's in a meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure Richard will be fine with that.  He's a single dad, so he will understand. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I can't believe her husband died. They were married for a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. Does she have any children? <EOS>
<BOS> How about other family members? <EOS>
<BOS> So, she's all alone now? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it is very sad. <EOS>
<BOS> I like that idea. What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea! We can take care of her yard, help clean her house, and bring her meals. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Susan. My son, Joseph. Today is his birthday. <EOS>
<BOS> 12 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He is growing up so fast. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he is having a birthday party with his friends. Then afterwards, we're meeting my parents for dinner. They want to take him out to a nice restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. We wanted to invite his friends over and have a pizza party. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he can eat a lot these days. He's a growing boy. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I bought one this time. I didn't have time to bake it this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no. I forgot to buy some and I don't have time to go to the store. The birthday guests are coming soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect! Thank you! <EOS>
<BOS> What news? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the new dress code? <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great!  I hate having to wear a suit every day. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good enough for me. <EOS>
<BOS> She's not coming to work today.  She's sick. <EOS>
<BOS> What's strange? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think she was going on a trip? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you're right! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, Jane! I had my last one this morning. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to celebrate? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. Should we throw a party? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I don't care. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Do you have any ideas? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds boring. I want to do something active. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall? <EOS>
<BOS> Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  It's my favorite book. <EOS>
<BOS> You should read it.  I have the book. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course.  Let me know what you think about it. <EOS>
<BOS> The stock market crashed. <EOS>
<BOS> Our company lost a lot of money. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know if the company can survive this big loss. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! I've never been to Hawaii. <EOS>
<BOS> My family and I go to Germany every summer. My grandparents live there. They are too old to travel, so we have to go there every year. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lot of fun. But I'd love to visit Hawaii someday. How long are you going to stay there? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do after you get back? <EOS>
<BOS> You're going to work the rest of the summer? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. I should do that too. <EOS>
<BOS> Two months. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. My mom doesn't get to see her parents that often, so we stay for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could do other fun things during the summer. <EOS>
<BOS> You know what they say about full moons. <EOS>
<BOS> Weird things happen when there's a full moon. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't believe it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you believe in werewolves? <EOS>
<BOS> Creatures that are half human, half wolf. They come out when there's a full moon. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Now you're being ridiculous. <EOS>
<BOS> What if you see a werewolf tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I feel like I live at the office. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not that easy. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I have no time for my personal life anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we just wait for everyone to arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  So how do you like this weather? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  It's been raining all week. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Have you been out of town? <EOS>
<BOS> I bet you miss the weather there. <EOS>
<BOS> What's the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> When you negotiate with someone, don't take things personally. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe that's his strategy. <EOS>
<BOS> Please call us.  We offer after sales service.   <EOS>
<BOS> We are here to help and support you with your new product after you leave the store. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not at all.  If you need help with installation or operation, please call our store any time. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Joe. My family and I are going to the lake. We're going to have picnic. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join us? <EOS>
<BOS> "Sure. We are leaving at 10 <EOS>
<BOS> You should pack swim trunks and a life jacket. <EOS>
<BOS> My parents are going to pack some food. There will be plenty for you too. <EOS>
<BOS> "Try to come back before 10 <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you can come with us. <EOS>
<BOS> See you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We're going to have dinner soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I said no, Billy.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, if you eat everything on your plate. <EOS>
<BOS> To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They are all overdue. <EOS>
<BOS> We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room. <EOS>
<BOS> About two months. <EOS>
<BOS> I found the notices in his room too. <EOS>
<BOS> He said he couldn't find them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going alone? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  How long do you want to stay there? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll pick you up at 4 o'clock.  We're having dinner with your grandparents at 5. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to mail this package to Italy. <EOS>
<BOS> Some toys and baby clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> I have it here. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. When will my package arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> I would like your fastest shipping. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> With my credit card. <EOS>
<BOS> No. That's it. <EOS>
<BOS> You too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> My son was in an auto accident last night. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago. <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks Alice. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Bill. I got laid off today. <EOS>
<BOS> The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position. <EOS>
<BOS> 15 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a family to take care of. <EOS>
<BOS> Not yet. She's at work. I didn't want to give her bad news there. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a graphic designer. <EOS>
<BOS> That's my specialty. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! I really appreciate it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  I thought you loved your apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a long time.  You live on the top floor. <EOS>
<BOS> When is it going to be fixed? <EOS>
<BOS> He needs to do something about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Tell him to walk up and down the stairs.  He may repair it quicker. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jeff. My family and I are going to the park to watch the fireworks. <EOS>
<BOS> We do that every year. It has become our annual family tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! It gets very crowded, so we leave early and just hang out at the park all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but it is very limited. <EOS>
<BOS> We usually go around 4 pm. The fireworks show starts around 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> No. He doesn't like loud noises. It scares him. A couple of years ago, he ran away during the fireworks show. <EOS>
<BOS> So, now we leave him with my parents on the fourth of July. Their neighborhood is very quiet. <EOS>
<BOS> Not anymore. They say it's too loud. Their neighborhood does not allow fireworks. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a quiet and safe place to watch them. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  I can't keep covering for you. <EOS>
<BOS> What is your excuse this time?   <EOS>
<BOS> You can't leave early for that. <EOS>
<BOS> You really shouldn't go tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  You were mean to me. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, you were.  You used to take my toys. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ok.  You're a great brother now. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds good.  Where do you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to go to Starbucks. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true, but it is overpriced and I like to support small businesses. <EOS>
<BOS> Fair enough. <EOS>
<BOS> I got the job! <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! I'm so excited. I beat out 4 other applicants. <EOS>
<BOS> Next Monday. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to go shopping for some new suits. We have to dress nicely in the office. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I wanted to tell you first. You're my best friend. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have to do that. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a deal! <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  That's great! <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I will ask my wife where she wants to go. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> It looks like your luggage is lost. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm very sorry.  If we locate it, we will send it to you right away. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  This company has been around for 30 years. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you worked there? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a long time.   <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you keep doing it for him? <EOS>
<BOS> He's such a slacker.  He doesn't do anything at all. <EOS>
<BOS> I know why.  He's the boss's son. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't let our boss hear you say that. <EOS>
<BOS> Just don't finish his work and see what the boss does. <EOS>
<BOS> Karen is having a meeting with Susie. <EOS>
<BOS> Susie's constant complaining. <EOS>
<BOS> It doesn't look good. <EOS>
<BOS> Susie is crying. <EOS>
<BOS> How about a cat? <EOS>
<BOS> Dogs are too much work. <EOS>
<BOS> No, you're not.  You just don't like cats. <EOS>
<BOS> A tree fell during the windstorm and hit my house. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Luckily, we weren't home at the time. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. It was the big tree in our yard. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. I'm waiting for the insurance guy to come right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we're going to stay at my parents' house. They don't live far from here. <EOS>
<BOS> I really liked that tree. It was so big and beautiful. And, now it's in my living room. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, if I don't laugh, I'll cry. <EOS>
<BOS> Believe me, Stan. I am crying on the inside. <EOS>
<BOS> She's organizing her office. <EOS>
<BOS> Everything has to be in the right place. <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. <EOS>
<BOS> Then don't move her things. <EOS>
<BOS> She's just a neat freak. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Joe. I did really badly on it. I failed it. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't study for it. I was too busy playing video games. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know if I can pass the class now. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm afraid to tell my parents. They will be very disappointed. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's good to hear. Maybe our science teacher will let me take it again. <EOS>
<BOS> I know! No more video games for me. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to our science teacher's office and talk to him about my test. Then I'm going to go to the library and study for my math test. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! I'll need it! <EOS>
<BOS> What rumor? <EOS>
<BOS> Where did you hear that? <EOS>
<BOS> Excuse me for minute.  I need to go to the restroom. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Transmission problems can be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you afford a new car? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Dad. I can't find my fishing pole. <EOS>
<BOS> In the garage. I'll look again. <EOS>
<BOS> I found my fishing pole. It was behind the skis. <EOS>
<BOS> She is packing food and snacks into the ice chest. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Dad, where is your fishing pole? <EOS>
<BOS> Are we going to the same campsite? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool. Can I bring my camera? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be careful. I want to take a lot of pictures. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope we catch big ones. I love camping and fishing. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to do there? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds boring. <EOS>
<BOS> I like being in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm on the phone. <EOS>
<BOS> It may be a while.  I'm talking to an angry client. <EOS>
<BOS> We're getting a lot of complaint calls since we started the new program. <EOS>
<BOS> What's going on today? <EOS>
<BOS> That is exciting! <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to buy a new or used car? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know which one you want? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice! <EOS>
<BOS> Make sure you negotiate a good deal. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm great at it. Do you want me to go with you to the dealership? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll drive since you will be driving your car home today. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need help? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Who should I speak with? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll take Technical Support.  You can have the angry customers. <EOS>
<BOS> I did not leave dog poop on your lawn. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of proof? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness.  I am very sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> What did the customer do? <EOS>
<BOS> Those are the worst customers.  I've had a few. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh Hi Cathy. My son is graduating college and Joe and I thought a trip would be a good graduation gift. <EOS>
<BOS> He's a good son, so Bob and I wanted to give him something special. <EOS>
<BOS> China. He studied the Chinese language in college and really enjoyed learning about the culture. <EOS>
<BOS> My brother moved there last year for work. He is going to show him around. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. And it will be safer too. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's going to be a surprise. So, if you see him, please don't mention anything. <EOS>
<BOS> Cathy, what are you doing here? <EOS>
<BOS> Now that's being really lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  What is wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you tell him we would try to fix it for free? <EOS>
<BOS> What is he demanding? <EOS>
<BOS> That is not how our policy works. <EOS>
<BOS> Computer? Did you buy a one? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! Have you learned a lot of stuff? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you get homework? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know how to open and save documents? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me know if you need any help? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. I will come over tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Mom. I'll eat before I come over. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds wonderful. See you around 8 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> When? <EOS>
<BOS> How? <EOS>
<BOS> The owner must be very angry. <EOS>
<BOS> Why not? <EOS>
<BOS> She is a clever woman and a great cook! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I'm also a little nervous.   <EOS>
<BOS> I hope my new boss is nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I always get my job done. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have any advice for me? <EOS>
<BOS> I will!  That's really important to me. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Should we divide the work? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll work on the presentation style. <EOS>
<BOS> This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice to hear. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a toothache. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! 4 pm is perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> "Ok. I will be there at 3 <EOS>
<BOS> Bye. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join me? <EOS>
<BOS> ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market. <EOS>
<BOS> You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons. <EOS>
<BOS> So, do you have any? <EOS>
<BOS> They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I can wait for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there something wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to exchange it for another size? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  The full amount will go back on your credit card. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you talk to your teacher about it? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you meet any with good potential? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think they will? <EOS>
<BOS> You should really take time to read through them.   <EOS>
<BOS> Networking is hard and it can be intimidating. <EOS>
<BOS> Be generous with your time.  You may find a gem or two.  <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Mark. No. I have to finish my chores. I didn't do them all week, so now I have to do them all today. <EOS>
<BOS> Rake the yard and clean my room. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you seen my room? It looks like a tornado went through it. <EOS>
<BOS> I hate cleaning. Do you have chores? <EOS>
<BOS> You're smart! Now, I have to spend Friday afternoon doing chores. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to help me with my chores? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I better get to work or I'll be doing it after dinner too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I say that every week. <EOS>
<BOS> Cool! <EOS>
<BOS> My son loves going to the games. He loves the hot dogs and cotton candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are your seats? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Those are fantastic seats! You have a nice boss. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a great time to bond with your children. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you taking your baseball mitts? <EOS>
<BOS> He may. You never know. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be amazing. He would probably love that. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, have a great time! I'll try to find you on TV. <EOS>
<BOS> He's in the conference room.  He's been waiting for you. <EOS>
<BOS> He's not going to be happy.  He's been waiting for an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll let him know. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can tell him now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, Robert. All of our relatives are coming. Did you forget? <EOS>
<BOS> How could you forget? We have a big party every year. This year it is at our house. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need any help? <EOS>
<BOS> I made some lemonade and I want to keep it cold during the party. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope the food stays fresh. <EOS>
<BOS> It's going to be a potluck. I am serving barbeque ribs and potatoes. <EOS>
<BOS> I think some people are going to bring salads, appetizers, and desserts. <EOS>
<BOS> I think everyone is coming, except Aunt Linda. She's feeling sick today. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. She's my favorite sister. <EOS>
<BOS> They're excited to see you too. But right now, please go buy some ice. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of pet? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot of responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> They are great companions. <EOS>
<BOS> What's the meeting about? <EOS>
<BOS> We just got raises last month. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck! <EOS>
<BOS> What about jewelry? <EOS>
<BOS> How about clothes? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you asked her what she wants? <EOS>
<BOS> How can you surprise her if she doesn't like your taste in anything? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't help you.  Sheila doesn't like my taste either. <EOS>
<BOS> The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors. <EOS>
<BOS> How about a picnic at the park? <EOS>
<BOS> How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should definitely go this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> That must've been boring. <EOS>
<BOS> The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them. Our family won't be able to go. The tickets expire this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that. <EOS>
<BOS> What is wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you move it? <EOS>
<BOS> You need to go to the emergency room. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have someone who can bring you here? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  Dr. Johnson will take a look at your arm.  Please come as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Dan.  Yes, I remember you.  How can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, of course I am.  Please email it to me.  Did I give you my business card? <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I look forward to receiving it.   <EOS>
<BOS> A book about traveling etiquette in foreign countries. <EOS>
<BOS> To one of our offices in Saudi Arabia. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you been there? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm reading about proper etiquette while I'm there. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been really sick. I had the flu. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I feel much better. I am going back to school on Monday. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Did I miss a lot of school work? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no. That makes me worry. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. She is a very strict. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! I can study them this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I might get sick again! <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thank you! <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I have to check my garage. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you moving? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a big chore. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, if you don't know what's in there, you probably don't need it. <EOS>
<BOS> I had to clean out my attic last month and my wife said the same thing to me. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do with all the stuff? <EOS>
<BOS> I threw half of it away and donated the other half. <EOS>
<BOS> What about the garage sale? <EOS>
<BOS> Good thinking! <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Cathy. She wants to be a ballerina. What about Sally? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cute. Are you going to make her costume? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm lucky. Amanda took ballet lessons last month, so she can wear her ballet outfit. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Costumes can be so expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> What was she last year? I can't remember. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right. She was so cute. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not a bad idea. It's going to be cold outside. Her costume will keep her warm. <EOS>
<BOS> Or you may have to make her costume again. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work. <EOS>
<BOS> I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am. I work out for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, how about lifting weights? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about aerobics? <EOS>
<BOS> Yoga? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I won't tell anyone.  Good luck! <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What time? <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect.  I get off work at 5 <EOS>
<BOS> There is a lot of construction going on in my neighborhood.  Let's just meet at the restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> I like all kinds of food. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds good.  Let's go there.   <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Did you check his office? <EOS>
<BOS> Try the employee lounge.  He's probably sleeping somewhere.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  He's such a slacker. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Kevin. I broke it while hiking last weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> We were hiking down a steep trail. I lost my balance and fell. <EOS>
<BOS> It was a long, painful walk. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I was with my wife. But I'm too heavy for her to carry me. <EOS>
<BOS> There was no cell phone coverage in that area. <EOS>
<BOS> Six weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! Looks like I am. I'm so disappointed. I've been training for that for a year. Why don't you go in my place? <EOS>
<BOS> What? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. What would you like to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a fun plan. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have to check. <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect weather for camping. <EOS>
<BOS> The kids are going to love it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yeah. We better think of another option just in case. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be fun too. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Here's the number. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you having money problems? <EOS>
<BOS> But you drive a nice car and wear expensive things. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think you need expensive things.  You just want them. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you're spoiled.  You need to set some priorities. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree, James. It was a stressful work week. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. When are you going to be done? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake? <EOS>
<BOS> No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be awesome! Thanks! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Me too. Call me this weekend if you get done early. <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  That's great news. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's have another cup right now. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess not everything causes cancer. <EOS>
<BOS> We have vacation time. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  We don't get any of those.   <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we should try to get a job there. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  It's my day off. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I totally understand.   <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry about it.  Just take care of your mom. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know what you want to invest in? <EOS>
<BOS> You should talk to my stockbroker. <EOS>
<BOS> I worked at a fast food restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> It was ok.  It was always busy. <EOS>
<BOS> I took orders at the counter and sometimes at the drive-thru window. <EOS>
<BOS> It wasn't fun. It was just a job. We had to work fast. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a good place to learn how to work quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, it's a good place to learn how to handle customers. <EOS>
<BOS> They will train you. You just have to be polite and listen well. <EOS>
<BOS> You should apply then. <EOS>
<BOS> I ate too much fast food working there. I got sick of it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's probably not a good thing. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. <EOS>
<BOS> I just went to the market a few days ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Did we really drink it that fast? <EOS>
<BOS> I will pick some up later today.  Have some eggs instead. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe I have to go grocery shopping again. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I just ate too much. <EOS>
<BOS> I always overeat during the holidays. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but Mom's cooking is the best. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I have room for dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Carol. I'm planning a birthday party for Tim. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well. I can't think of anything to do. <EOS>
<BOS> He wants to invite all of the boys in his classroom. That's 12 boys. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't want to invite any girls. <EOS>
<BOS> We did that last year and it rained. <EOS>
<BOS> I was thinking about taking the kids to a pizza place. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I love that idea! Then they can play in our backyard if it doesn't rain. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for your help. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Helen. I'm taking my grandchildren to a butterfly conservatory today. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a place that displays butterflies and you can learn all about them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but these butterflies are alive. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, they fly around the room and sometimes they even land on you. A butterfly landed on my head once. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. There are so many different kinds of butterflies too. They're so beautiful. Their colors and designs are spectacular. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. <EOS>
<BOS> But times have changed. Kids prefer to watch television and play video games these days. <EOS>
<BOS> My granddaughter is 5 years old and my grandson is 7 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> My granddaughter likes to draws butterflies and my grandson loves insects. So, I thought they would love this. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I better go now. <EOS>
<BOS> How did that happen? <EOS>
<BOS> I was the last one to work on it. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing.  I saved the file and went home. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you blaming me for this problem? <EOS>
<BOS> You are so rude.  That's why no one wants to work with you. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's order something for delivery. <EOS>
<BOS> There are a lot of choices around our neighborhood. <EOS>
<BOS> We can order pizza, Chinese food, Indian food, sandwiches, or something else. <EOS>
<BOS> I can eat anything.  I am very hungry now. <EOS>
<BOS> I am so hungry.  There may not be any leftovers. <EOS>
<BOS> I try my best. I love plants. <EOS>
<BOS> How, Alice? <EOS>
<BOS> That's strange. <EOS>
<BOS> That's sad. Plants are beautiful and they provide oxygen too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I'm going on vacation tomorrow. I'll be gone for a couple of weeks. We can start after I get back. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Let's get a couple of plants that require low maintenance. <EOS>
<BOS> Plants that don't need much attention. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll make a list of good plants to start with. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I was going to ask you to water them for me, but I think I'll ask my sister instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  It is so underrated. <EOS>
<BOS> People do not know how great the food is here. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  However, if this place doesn't get more customers, they may go out of business. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I have not. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Is she nice? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool!  We should take her to the coffee shop later. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. That sounds fun. Should we invite some friends? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. But we should buy some mosquito repellent this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you remember what happened last time? <EOS>
<BOS> It was awful. We were itchy for days. <EOS>
<BOS> I think there are special candles that keep mosquitoes away. I saw a commercial for it a couple of days ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, I'll put it on the shopping list for the barbeque. <EOS>
<BOS> We'll have to tell them we have mosquito repellent this time. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. Now I feel like having an indoor party. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Bill. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. <EOS>
<BOS> What did you say? <EOS>
<BOS> She always hangs out at Linda's house or the library. <EOS>
<BOS> How about her house. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you called her cell phone. <EOS>
<BOS> She must really be mad at you. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm really curious now. What did you say to her? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds better. Hope you find her. <EOS>
<BOS> Who were you talking to for an hour? <EOS>
<BOS> When is the last time you talked to him? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That was 30 years ago! <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Carol. Yes. Actually, my daughter, Sylvia, is in the competition. <EOS>
<BOS> You should. It's a lot of fun, but also very stressful. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's amazing. Is that why you became an English teacher? <EOS>
<BOS> You should come with us tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> "7 pm. But we will have to leave around 6 <EOS>
<BOS> We do too. Do you have any advice for her? <EOS>
<BOS> Someone just broke out of prison. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm glad we have a big dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Be careful with that thing. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope the police catch him soon. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you get tickets?  The concert is sold out. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great!  Where are the seats? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  Those are awesome seats! <EOS>
<BOS> Why can't she go? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  We should get her a thank you gift. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, I don't want to go to the piano recital tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I've practiced almost every day for three months, but I'm afraid I'm going to mess up. <EOS>
<BOS> My piano teacher says I'm ready, but I don't think I am. <EOS>
<BOS> You were nervous, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Then you were fine? <EOS>
<BOS> Can we have ice cream afterwards? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll do it. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, I'll be ok. I was just a little nervous. Thank you for your support. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Ruth. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Does she like living there? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year. <EOS>
<BOS> My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you can't take the train across the ocean. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I can't.   <EOS>
<BOS> I already have plans. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Maybe next weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to have a great time tonight too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm having dinner with our boss. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  She looked very surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you know? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure?  She looked really surprised to me. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess you can't believe everything you see. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  How can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Do you need help with the content? <EOS>
<BOS> I can help you with that. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Let's go into the conference room. <EOS>
<BOS> You'll be fine.  I will help you. <EOS>
<BOS> What other kinds of shoes are you going to sell? <EOS>
<BOS> Your soccer shoes are very popular, so basketball shoes should be a hit too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm in Sales and Marketing.  I can help you. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to.  Let's set up a meeting to discuss the details. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm very sorry to hear that.  We can exchange the jacket for you. <EOS>
<BOS> You can return it by mail or return it to one of our stores. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you feel about that? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you get separate hotel rooms? <EOS>
<BOS> Then what is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Your boss is really nice.  You shouldn't worry. <EOS>
<BOS> You're worrying too much.  Just be yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Kevin. I've been here since 11 am. <EOS>
<BOS> 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I have a lot of homework to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I have. I took a lunch break at 1 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I still have a little more to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's too noisy at home. I can't concentrate. <EOS>
<BOS> I won't. I never forget to eat. Are you leaving now? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm kind of hungry too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. That sounds good. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I need to get this report done. I'm almost finished. Then I'll go home. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with this place? <EOS>
<BOS> I think this stuff looks cool. <EOS>
<BOS> This place was advertised in a magazine. <EOS>
<BOS> An expensive furniture magazine. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you have bad taste. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Carol. Yeah, I'm taking dancing classes and I need new dancing shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> At the local community center. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm really enjoying it. <EOS>
<BOS> We're learning a few different types of dance. So far, we have learned ballet, modern, and tap. <EOS>
<BOS> I like tap dance. Ballet was pretty hard. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. Do you want to join? Our class is not full. <EOS>
<BOS> No, you are not. You should come to one of our classes. The first visit is free. <EOS>
<BOS> Every Monday evening at 7 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. That's why I'm taking lessons. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I am going to fail it. <EOS>
<BOS> My notes will not help me. <EOS>
<BOS> I was too embarrassed to tell her I didn't understand.   <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Kathy. Yeah. Let's have lunch. <EOS>
<BOS> How about pizza? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Do you have any suggestions? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like raw fish. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I just don't feel like having sushi today. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we should just order take-out. You get sushi and I'll get pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> Chinese food sounds yummy. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd rather eat at home. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious?  Who did he kill? <EOS>
<BOS> This is a huge scandal. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm reading the news. <EOS>
<BOS> They post what's going on in the news. <EOS>
<BOS> It's more fun than the news channels.  Real news is boring. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to get a new phone. <EOS>
<BOS> John Taylor. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a basic phone right now. I would like to upgrade. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I would like to be able to check e-mails and surf the Internet. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like something that is not too expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I would also like a good camera. <EOS>
<BOS> It feels a little heavy. Do you have anything lighter in weight? <EOS>
<BOS> This one seems nice. Does it come with a warranty? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! I will get this one. <EOS>
<BOS> No. You have been very helpful. <EOS>
<BOS> He's late. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  He says he has car troubles. <EOS>
<BOS> No. This time it's the transmission. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Bob. I coach my son's baseball team. We're having our first practice today. <EOS>
<BOS> 8 years old. He's been playing baseball for a couple of years. <EOS>
<BOS> He loves it! This is my first year as a coach. I'm pretty excited. <EOS>
<BOS> What position did you play? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. Do you miss it? <EOS>
<BOS> My son is a pitcher too. Maybe you can give him some tips on how to throw. <EOS>
<BOS> We have our first game next Saturday. Would you like to come and watch? <EOS>
<BOS> 10 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. <EOS>
<BOS> Are your kids getting the flu shot this year? <EOS>
<BOS> They did? <EOS>
<BOS> What about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Bill won't get one. <EOS>
<BOS> I completely understand that. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I think I'm going to make an appointment for all of us. <EOS>
<BOS> No. He won't go. He'll just cancel his appointment. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. Ok, I better call the doctor's office now. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm throwing a birthday party for my sister, Alison. Would you like to come? <EOS>
<BOS> It starts at 5 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! <EOS>
<BOS> At my house. <EOS>
<BOS> No need to bring anything. <EOS>
<BOS> That isn't t necessary. <EOS>
<BOS> She loves music. <EOS>
<BOS> She likes pop music. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. That's really nice of you. See you on Saturday. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't get your hopes too high. <EOS>
<BOS> Probably not hard enough to our managers. <EOS>
<BOS> What's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you almost done? <EOS>
<BOS> You better get some rest before you get sicker. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, Dad. <EOS>
<BOS> Will I get an allowance like Susie? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What else? <EOS>
<BOS> These are easy. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Do I have to do all of these things every day? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not fair. <EOS>
<BOS> She's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know Susie. I think I want a raise in my allowance. <EOS>
<BOS> If I have to share chores with my sister, I'm going to be doing most of the work. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything wrong with them? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you have had these for a long time.  It looks like you have already worn them a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> We only accept returns on unused items. <EOS>
<BOS> What is her name? <EOS>
<BOS> What is she doing here? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm taking Spanish right now. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll try.  Hopefully, she won't laugh at me. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure, Mom? Is someone coming over this morning? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, how nice. What are we making? <EOS>
<BOS> Yummy! That sounds delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, you always make too much food. It looks like a breakfast buffet every time they come over. <EOS>
<BOS> Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong, Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> Dad! Mom needs you to buy some eggs! <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Jack. Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I did well. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> How? What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have any plans for the summer. I can help you if you need it. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know when summer school starts? <EOS>
<BOS> That's right after regular school ends. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I'll help you. <EOS>
<BOS> We're going to take the train to my mother's house. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We usually drive, but we decided to take the train this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes. He has several trains and Jason built him a big wooden train track. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> One of his toy trains looks just like the train we're going to take. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. I'll frame it and hang it on his bedroom wall. <EOS>
<BOS> Cathy, it's a surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Just a short family trip. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. It was her idea. <EOS>
<BOS> She is at the store getting things for our trip. <EOS>
<BOS> No. You have to be patient. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Why don't you pack your swimsuit and life jacket? <EOS>
<BOS> You do? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you know? <EOS>
<BOS> It looks like I can't keep a secret. <EOS>
<BOS> Sarah and I had an argument. <EOS>
<BOS> She didn't like the gift I got her. <EOS>
<BOS> A vacuum cleaner. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what she said. Now she's mad at me. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a practical gift. Something she can use all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> A watch. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a practical gift. Something I can use all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> What should I do? <EOS>
<BOS> When do you want to buy a house? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you can do it. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you have a very realistic goal. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  How long will you be gone? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  What do I need? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  Have a great trip. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sue. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. It's a holiday that we celebrate once a year. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. It's on October 31. <EOS>
<BOS> People dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. They knock on the doors and say 'Trick or Treat.' Then the home owner gives out candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Not many adults. It's usually just children. <EOS>
<BOS> It can be. But parents go with them. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't do this in your native country? <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lot of fun. Your son will enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to speak with the manager. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  These shoes do not fit. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I want a refund. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> Who reads the receipt? <EOS>
<BOS> I am calling my lawyer! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I don't know why I bought it. <EOS>
<BOS> That was the plan. <EOS>
<BOS> I wasted my money. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to get drinks after work? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  My boss is putting too much pressure on me.   <EOS>
<BOS> Let's meet at 6 PM at the bar across the street. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you receive an invitation to the family reunion? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. But it was all a misunderstanding. <EOS>
<BOS> I would really like to see you there. I haven't seen you in a while. <EOS>
<BOS> If you don't go to the reunion, maybe I can visit you. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I would love to visit you and check out the city. <EOS>
<BOS> I still want you to come to the reunion. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I hope to see you there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I watched it at the arena. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I went with my co-workers. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. We were all screaming. The crowd was out of control. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It was getting a little scary. The security guards came and escorted someone out of the arena. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. He was out of control. He threw beer on a stranger. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, everyone was getting really upset at the drunk guy. That's why security was called. <EOS>
<BOS> It really was. I don't know if I want to go to another game for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to hang out? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. It's Friday and I'm bored. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a good movie to see? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me log onto my computer. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny. <EOS>
<BOS> There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, let's go to comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater. <EOS>
<BOS> It starts at 7 pm. Let's do dinner too. <EOS>
<BOS> See you tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> That's weird. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you talked to him? <EOS>
<BOS> That's rude. <EOS>
<BOS> I think there's an empty desk on the other side of the office. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, Candace is moving away. <EOS>
<BOS> Her dad got a job in another state. <EOS>
<BOS> To California. That's across the country. <EOS>
<BOS> But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her. <EOS>
<BOS> At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, please. That would be great. We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we visit her in California? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, we do. Candace and her family. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It was amazing! <EOS>
<BOS> It's our first championship. <EOS>
<BOS> We set off fireworks. <EOS>
<BOS> I recorded the game.  I'm going to watch it again tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure!  <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> I hope no one was injured. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible.   <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  This is the second time this week. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Get in the car.  I'll take you to school again. <EOS>
<BOS> Try not to miss the bus tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have places to send your resume? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have any connections? <EOS>
<BOS> You have to get involved and attend events. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  It's a big tournament with many companies participating.   <EOS>
<BOS> Talk to a lot of people and don't forget to take your business cards. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I have a few clients attending.  <EOS>
<BOS> Raffle and gift bags?  Isn't that a little childish? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious?  Can our company afford this? <EOS>
<BOS> That's definitely going to keep them happy. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong, Susie? Didn't you have a good time at the birthday party? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you eat too much food at the party? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you eat? <EOS>
<BOS> That is a lot of food. <EOS>
<BOS> Susie, that's why your stomach hurts. You ate too much. Why did you eat so much? <EOS>
<BOS> Susie, I think you should go lie down for a while? <EOS>
<BOS> Susie, where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I'm fine. I'm just planning the menu for the Thanksgiving dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to bring your delicious pumpkin pies again? Everyone loved them last year. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I think your sisters are bringing salads and other side dishes. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think so. I think they have to go to visit their In-laws this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe three? That should be plenty. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, probably around 20 pounds. <EOS>
<BOS> I like having leftovers. I make turkey sandwiches and soups for your Dad. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? Is it serious? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I know. The price tags were on the bottom of the pans. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What kind of logo? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of clothing are you launching? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  What kind of logo are you interested in? <EOS>
<BOS> I can do that.  Are the clothes for girls or boys? <EOS>
<BOS> I think Cathy was using it yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Did she leave a mess? <EOS>
<BOS> You must be a neat freak. <EOS>
<BOS> His music is so loud. <EOS>
<BOS> He's not going to do anything.   <EOS>
<BOS> But the rent is cheap here. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a tough choice. <EOS>
<BOS> What if we find another place with a noisy neighbor? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. My name is Monica. <EOS>
<BOS> I live on the fourth floor in 405. <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. I hope I'm not too noisy. I've been moving furniture around. <EOS>
<BOS> I met a few people. Everyone seems friendly here. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds fun! I love parties and potlucks. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds delicious. I'll make a chocolate cake. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for letting me know about the party. <EOS>
<BOS> I better check the mailbox then. I still have so much unpacking to do. <EOS>
<BOS> No. My brother helped me last night. I'm done with the big items. I just need to unpack pots and pans and dishes now. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you happy about that? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  Just try to do your best in your new position. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess I'll have to do the presentation alone. <EOS>
<BOS> I have no choice. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  The clients are catching a flight right after the meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> I bought an ESL teaching CD and I visit ESL websites. <EOS>
<BOS> They are very helpful.   <EOS>
<BOS> I practice every day.  I want to become a US citizen. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to take the test next year.   <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful.  You are a great friend. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I didn't see you there. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  Something crazy happened there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  He got really drunk. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  She was not happy to see that. <EOS>
<BOS> How was the food? <EOS>
<BOS> How was the service? <EOS>
<BOS> We should go back together. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could've joined you tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> A little, but I still feel sick. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you! I love clam chowder. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I love good seafood. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been waiting? <EOS>
<BOS> That's 30 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> There are still several people ahead of us. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later. <EOS>
<BOS> Bye Kevin. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! <EOS>
<BOS> Who did you hear that from? <EOS>
<BOS> Nope.  Well, look at the time.  I need to go now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I'm late for a meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with my look? <EOS>
<BOS> I like my long hair. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm afraid to. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe I will.  It's hard to maintain this long hair. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  You talked me into it. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. I'm having a hard time with the conclusion of my report. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe just a little. Do you have time tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. I understand. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow is good for me too. Can I come over or would you like to come here. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Then let's meet at my house. <EOS>
<BOS> How about 5 pm? I can make you dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> What's your favorite dish? <EOS>
<BOS> Spaghetti and meatballs are my specialty. I'll make that. <EOS>
<BOS> See you tomorrow night. <EOS>
<BOS> May I ask what is wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry, but we do not have any more rooms available tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  I'm very sorry, but all of the rooms are occupied. <EOS>
<BOS> We will discount your room rate. <EOS>
<BOS> May we offer you a free stay next time?   It will be a room with a view.  I will guarantee it. <EOS>
<BOS> We still have much more work to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea.  I'll take half of it home. <EOS>
<BOS> We can email each other what we finish and review it together. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think we'll finish by Monday?  <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let's get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of business? <EOS>
<BOS> You're a great cook.  Your restaurant would do well. <EOS>
<BOS> You're smart.  You can do this. <EOS>
<BOS> When do you want to achieve this goal? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me know if you need an accountant.  I'm great with numbers. <EOS>
<BOS> I run my own business. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a website that teaches English to non-native speakers. <EOS>
<BOS> Advertisements, downloads, and software purchases. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> How long will you be gone? <EOS>
<BOS> How many times a day should I walk him? <EOS>
<BOS> He's going to give me a lot of exercise.   <EOS>
<BOS> No problem.  He's a great dog! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I invited one of our clients. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he good-looking? <EOS>
<BOS> I want to throw Mom a surprise birthday party. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know who we should invite? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have their phone numbers or e-mail addresses? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think Dad can keep a secret? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yeah. Mom was so surprised. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's serve Mom's favorite food, pasta. I can cook. <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect. Should we get together to discuss all of the plans? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have some things to do. Can I meet you at 5 pm? <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you come to my house? I can make us dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> That's the last one we have. <EOS>
<BOS> I can give you 30% off the price. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Alan. I'm doing some extra credit to improve my grade in History class. <EOS>
<BOS> C. <EOS>
<BOS> It's an average grade. I want to get a better grade. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to write a ten-page essay on my favorite president. <EOS>
<BOS> I have two weeks to finish it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'm going to do it on Abraham Lincoln. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a lot of information here at the library. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I've checked out some books and printed some information from websites. <EOS>
<BOS> I have so much to read and write. I hope I have enough time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you're right. I better stop talking and start reading. <EOS>
<BOS> Our lantern is broken. <EOS>
<BOS> We are going camping this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> How was the weather last month? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it is going to rain this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> The kids still want to go. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. We're going to pack some extra clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> Mike. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a tent I can borrow? <EOS>
<BOS> I just discovered a hole in our tent. <EOS>
<BOS> It's hard, but I try. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't stay at work too late. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't work at home.  Try to have a personal life too. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  But try to make priorities. <EOS>
<BOS> Enjoying life is healthy for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Susie. I need to buy my sister a new necklace. I accidentally lost her necklace and she is really mad at me now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could borrow it. <EOS>
<BOS> She wasn't home and it looked nice with my outfit, so I wore it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I feel terrible. I was going to put it back when I got home. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I was on my way home and I noticed it was gone. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm looking for a replacement here. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a gold butterfly. <EOS>
<BOS> That's it! That's exactly like hers? How much is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's expensive. Now I see why she was really mad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. That's all the money I have until my next paycheck. <EOS>
<BOS> This is Janet Lee from room 112.   <EOS>
<BOS> I paid for a room with an attached office, but this hotel room has no office. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I'm on a business trip, so an office is important to me. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll call a plumber. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> It's in good condition. <EOS>
<BOS> We just need to fix the leak. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right.  We need a new sink. <EOS>
<BOS> Hello Tommy. Why do you look so sad? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, can you do yard work? <EOS>
<BOS> How about mowing and watering the lawn? <EOS>
<BOS> Bill and I are getting too old to do it. Our son used to take care of our yard, but he moved to another state. <EOS>
<BOS> When can you start? <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. The grass is growing really high. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, Tommy. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. Silly me. How does $30 a week sound? <EOS>
<BOS> If you do a good job, I may give you more work. I need someone to paint my fence. <EOS>
<BOS> You're a good boy, Tommy. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.   <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Aren't you worried? <EOS>
<BOS> Unless we get laid off during the process. <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you hear the news? <EOS>
<BOS> He got into a car accident last week. <EOS>
<BOS> No. He's in the hospital. He broke both of his legs and ribs. He also has a head injury. <EOS>
<BOS> Judy has come home a couple of times to get a change of clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> She is a very worried wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Bob and I visited him in the hospital a couple of days ago. He is on so much medication. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> The doctors told her he may be there for several months. <EOS>
<BOS> Their children are helping her right now. They're taking turns staying at the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> I was just on the phone with my daughter. She is having a baby. <EOS>
<BOS> This will be our first grandchild. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn't know yet. She is only three months pregnant. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I'm going to be a grandmother in June. How many grandchildren do you have, Joan? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I remember now. They visit you often. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so excited. I'm going to go shopping to buy my grandchild some clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But I love looking at baby clothes. Do you want to go with me? <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Bobby. She packs me the same lunch every day. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cookies, and milk. <EOS>
<BOS> I love tuna sandwiches. Do you want to trade? <EOS>
<BOS> No. She won't know. I won't tell her. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it looks gross. <EOS>
<BOS> Which ones have you tried? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza. Those are my favorite dishes at home. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with lunch? Let's go out to recess. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market. <EOS>
<BOS> The one down the street. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I always go to that market. <EOS>
<BOS> It's always so crowded there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I still like the smaller store. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to try something different this year? <EOS>
<BOS> Where should we go? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds nice. <EOS>
<BOS> We can celebrate our anniversary there. <EOS>
<BOS> We haven't been to the beach in a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> No way, Mark. I don't have any talents. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a unicycle? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool. I wish I had a talent. <EOS>
<BOS> I know some magic tricks. My brother taught me last summer. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never been on stage before. I would be too scared to stand in front of an audience. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll just cheer you on from the audience. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! Can you teach me how to juggle? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I'm kind of getting sick of the same place. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to try Indian? <EOS>
<BOS> I've never had it before either. <EOS>
<BOS> To try something different. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we try a new one each week? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, so we'll have Indian tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's decide that next week. One place at a time. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. Let's find a restaurant soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we set up a meeting to discuss the details of the work? <EOS>
<BOS> When are you free? <EOS>
<BOS> I have an all-day meeting on Tuesday.  What about Wednesday? <EOS>
<BOS> Friday works for me.  Should we do a lunch meeting? <EOS>
<BOS> Have a good business trip and I'll see you next Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> No, they're not.  Cats are the best. <EOS>
<BOS> Cats are cute and cuddly. <EOS>
<BOS> Cats are smart.  They can use a litter box. <EOS>
<BOS> Not as smart as cats. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, no. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I just got done with a project.  Do you need some help? <EOS>
<BOS> What can I help you with? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  Just tell me what to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a couple of free days before my next assignment. <EOS>
<BOS> No problem.  I'm always happy to help my co-workers. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It's annoying. <EOS>
<BOS> She would complain about her next job too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. How long have they been married? <EOS>
<BOS> 50 years! That's a really long time. <EOS>
<BOS> That's amazing! We should definitely do something special. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect! That's going to be so beautiful. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's meet at Mom's tonight and plan the whole party. <EOS>
<BOS> We can show pictures of their wedding, their children, and grandchildren. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What? You're pregnant? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  What should we see? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like horror movies.  They are scary. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's watch a comedy with my favorite actor. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! You must be a fan too. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> 2000. <EOS>
<BOS> What was your major? <EOS>
<BOS> I studied Law, too! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm Karen. Nice to meet you, Matthew. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I'm going to watch it at home. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd love to. We can watch our college football team win tonight! <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds great. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. See you tonight, Matthew. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  How much do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have that much.  How about $200? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It can be hard. <EOS>
<BOS> I stopped talking to him. <EOS>
<BOS> He can be very annoying. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Is there an accident? <EOS>
<BOS> Should I cancel our dinner reservations? <EOS>
<BOS> I will call the restaurant and ask them. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't drive while talking on your cell phone.  It's dangerous. <EOS>
<BOS> Drive safely. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> One of the managers, Kevin Johnson.  Have you met him? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to know.  Any advice? <EOS>
<BOS> That can be annoying. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't hear about that. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't watch the news. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I missed that too.  <EOS>
<BOS> No, I didn't.  What's happening? <EOS>
<BOS> Where did you hear this? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you worried? <EOS>
<BOS> Then I should be more worried than you. <EOS>
<BOS> I've only been here for four months! <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I called this morning and left a message with the receptionist. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> I asked the receptionist to print my report and give it to Sharon. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to talk to the receptionist first. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What time is his flight? <EOS>
<BOS> Where do I drop him off? <EOS>
<BOS> Downtown?  I need to come back downtown during rush hour? <EOS>
<BOS> Dinner too?    <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work flexible hours? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could work flexible hours. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't.  I'm in Accounting, so I have to work regular business hours. <EOS>
<BOS> They are having a special.  If you order a donut, you get a cup of coffee for free. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  How do you drink your coffee? <EOS>
<BOS> I like black coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope they don't run out of coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be worse. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> No, thank you. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like anything that is raw. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been waiting? <EOS>
<BOS> This is a very old building.   <EOS>
<BOS> We're on the 18th floor! <EOS>
<BOS> I'll come with you. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll wait for the elevator. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought we agreed to buy the red one. <EOS>
<BOS> You always change your mind. <EOS>
<BOS> What if you change your mind again after we buy it? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let's buy the blue one. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing.  You said you wanted blue. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let's eat in from now on. <EOS>
<BOS> I can try to cook too. <EOS>
<BOS> That's why we eat out all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know how to make meatballs? <EOS>
<BOS> It might be easier to eat out. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you take my table's order? <EOS>
<BOS> It's an important call. <EOS>
<BOS> It'll be just a few more minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> That's none of your business. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be right there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I would like to exchange this sweater for another size.  <EOS>
<BOS> I need a large. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Thank you. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I will take it. <EOS>
<BOS> No, thank you.  I would just like to exchange the sweater, please. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I buy all of my books online. <EOS>
<BOS> It is much cheaper than bookstores. <EOS>
<BOS> Shipping is free! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  It was an amazing magic trick. <EOS>
<BOS> It did, but it was just magic. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Don't believe everything you see. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll let the boss know. <EOS>
<BOS> I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud. <EOS>
<BOS> They are on vacation. They left the kids home. <EOS>
<BOS> They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down. <EOS>
<BOS> I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> I think the home improvement store is having a big sale this weekend. Is your dishwasher broken? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you tried to repair it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. At least he was honest about it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right. You had a baby not too long ago. Why don't you buy a used one? <EOS>
<BOS> I actually have a friend who is selling hers. She said there isn't anything wrong with her current one. She just wants a different color. Her current one is white. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. Let me call her right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me know if he's interested. <EOS>
<BOS> I like going to my parents' lake house. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to drive a couple of hours from here.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I agree.  It's very relaxing there. <EOS>
<BOS> The company's security team. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn't hear the news?  The company's database was hacked. <EOS>
<BOS> That means someone got access to our data without the company's authorization. <EOS>
<BOS> Customers and employees. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Our company could get sued. <EOS>
<BOS> I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home. <EOS>
<BOS> I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. <EOS>
<BOS> What is he holding? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I don't come into the office every day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I just make sure I work 40 hours a week. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  My boss gave me a flexible schedule because I am a single parent. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm very lucky.   <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you should ask your boss about working a flexible schedule too. <EOS>
<BOS> Cool! What have you made so far? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like the class? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it hard to do? <EOS>
<BOS> What made you decide to take a pottery class? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could take a class. I'm so busy with work and school. <EOS>
<BOS> Retirement sounds great. <EOS>
<BOS> You must have a lot of hobbies. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow, you must have a lot of great homemade items. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Nancy. I'm not. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm too shy. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for the compliment. I'm scared to sing in front of an audience. <EOS>
<BOS> My mom said the same thing. <EOS>
<BOS> What if I get on stage and I freeze. <EOS>
<BOS> I do love singing. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me think about it. <EOS>
<BOS> How does she know? She never heard me sing. <EOS>
<BOS> You did? Did she like it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have another deadline? <EOS>
<BOS> How does your family feel about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Working full-time while raising kids is hard work. <EOS>
<BOS> There was a chemical explosion a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, over 50 people were injured.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  Don't take the elevator. <EOS>
<BOS> I just found out that I won't be graduating this year. <EOS>
<BOS> There's nothing I can do right now. <EOS>
<BOS> No way. They are going to be so mad. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I just don't know how? My last report card was bad. I promised that I would improve my grades. <EOS>
<BOS> I will have to. They're probably going to take my car away. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'm going to need it. Do you have an extra room at your house? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you thought about investing in stocks? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  My brother lost a lot of money in stocks. <EOS>
<BOS> However, I also know a few people who made a lot of money investing in stocks. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to be smart. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right! <EOS>
<BOS> No, Mary. Where did you last see it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's strange. Where could it be? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. We'll find it. Let's look for it together. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure? Where did you go to take a break? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you do anything else? <EOS>
<BOS> You go check outside and I'll check the kitchen. <EOS>
<BOS> What's that on the kitchen counter? <EOS>
<BOS> How did it get there? <EOS>
<BOS> You must be studying too hard. Take another break. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I can't believe she's getting a divorce already. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought they would get divorced after one year. <EOS>
<BOS> This actually shouldn't be big news. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been on a no-sugar diet. <EOS>
<BOS> I miss eating sweet desserts. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you should try a no-fat diet. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Peter.  I'm Ted, the manager of the IT department. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right.  There was an issue with your computer. <EOS>
<BOS> No problem.  You can call my office any time if you have any technical issues. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Kathy. I'm going back-to-school shopping with the kids. <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any good sales going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Good. I need to buy clothes and shoes for my daughter. She has outgrown all of her clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> Jenny grew four inches during the summer. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. She eats a lot these days. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I will be shopping for clothes, shoes, and school supplies today. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not like crowds. We should've done this earlier. We always wait until the last minute every year. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. It's going to be a long day. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I have to work. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm staying late tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I need to get some things done. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what my wife says. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Tonight's our wedding anniversary too. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> That could be a big problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot. There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week. <EOS>
<BOS> Today is the last day of the sale. <EOS>
<BOS> Isn't your husband a great repairman. Maybe he can fix your refrigerator. <EOS>
<BOS> If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  How much? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Is there anything else you need from the market? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll be home in an hour.   <EOS>
<BOS> What happened, Susan? <EOS>
<BOS> How did that happen? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, can't you just make another reservation? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> What about another hotel in that area. <EOS>
<BOS> Did the hotel apologize? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you accept it? <EOS>
<BOS> What did they say? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I am the store manager.  How can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> I am very sorry to hear that.  Could you please tell me which clerk? <EOS>
<BOS> I will talk to Bob as soon as possible.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know! 2015 went by so fast. <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> No. Do you make one every year? <EOS>
<BOS> What were they? <EOS>
<BOS> If you can't achieve them, why do you make one every year? <EOS>
<BOS> Was there ever a successful resolution? <EOS>
<BOS> Then your resolution for the New Year should be not to make any more resolutions. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a warranty? <EOS>
<BOS> We will repair the vacuum cleaner for free.  <EOS>
<BOS> 3-5 business days. <EOS>
<BOS> What's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> It's too late. <EOS>
<BOS> He's standing right behind you. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard she is really picky. <EOS>
<BOS> What should I do? <EOS>
<BOS> Can you listen to my presentation and let me know what you think? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, are you ok? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. That was scary. We've experience hurricanes, but never an earthquake. <EOS>
<BOS> Be careful. There could be aftershocks. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Where are the dogs? <EOS>
<BOS> They must be scared. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me find the radio. We can listen to the news. <EOS>
<BOS> Do we have any batteries for it? <EOS>
<BOS> I knew the big one was coming one day, but we weren't prepared. <EOS>
<BOS> We better pack an emergency kit for next time. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm spraying my house with pesticide. <EOS>
<BOS> I think we left some food around outside and it attracted ants. Now they're coming into the house. <EOS>
<BOS> This morning, I found some on the kitchen counter. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. That's why I'm wearing a mask. I need to take care of this problem as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> Did it work? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's good to know. Maybe we will go stay at a hotel for a few days. <EOS>
<BOS> No, that's ok. Carol is so upset because of the ants. I'll take her on a short trip. <EOS>
<BOS> World peace and ending world hunger. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't agree? <EOS>
<BOS> These hopes are for the younger generation. <EOS>
<BOS> One step at a time. <EOS>
<BOS> The world needs good leaders now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I got it yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> It's pretty, but it hurts my shoulder. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I'm going to return it. <EOS>
<BOS> What is he doing? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see.  Yeah, I've seen him do that. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought Todd didn't like the boss. <EOS>
<BOS> What a brown-noser! <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn't need a phone yet.  She's too young. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you think? <EOS>
<BOS> She's only 10.  If she has an emergency, she would be with one of us. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you need help with? <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> It looks like your glue is not strong enough. <EOS>
<BOS> I have stronger glue in the garage.  Let me get it. <EOS>
<BOS> Be very careful with it.  This glue is very powerful. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe it's not working. <EOS>
<BOS> Be patient.  It's a very old building. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm pretty open all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> You should go home.   <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you told him to stop? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, if it's making you crazy, you need to tell him. <EOS>
<BOS> There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I hope no one was seriously injured. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I didn't see it happen. <EOS>
<BOS> After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving. <EOS>
<BOS> We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now. <EOS>
<BOS> Not yet.  We're still working on it. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea.  Maybe she has questions about the contract. <EOS>
<BOS> I know she loves French food. <EOS>
<BOS> Did she call a meeting with everyone? <EOS>
<BOS> She's not easy to negotiate with. <EOS>
<BOS> She's not good at giving raises.   <EOS>
<BOS> Talk fast.  She's very impatient. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok!  Good luck and let me know what happens. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, the rates have gone up.   <EOS>
<BOS> Your loan payments will be higher. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  There's nothing I can do. <EOS>
<BOS> That's probably a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I will keep your loan application on file. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's so sad. <EOS>
<BOS> When is his last day? <EOS>
<BOS> That soon? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! He's been at the company for 20 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Is anyone going to throw him a retirement party? <EOS>
<BOS> If no one is, we should throw him one. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know who is taking his place? <EOS>
<BOS> Bob? Is he qualified for that position? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not happy. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm waiting to go on a conference call. <EOS>
<BOS> My boss and the vice president. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  This is my first time talking with the vice president. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you need to contact him? <EOS>
<BOS> That's why he's not returning your calls. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey John. No, the airplane ticket is too expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm just going to spend it here in the dormitory. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'll just use the time to study. <EOS>
<BOS> No, that's ok. I don't want to be a burden. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure? I would really like that. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. You're a great friend. <EOS>
<BOS> What time are we leaving? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me pay for gas. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds great! Thanks again. I'll be ready soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Congratulations! What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you think it is? <EOS>
<BOS> That would be lovely. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, marriage can go by quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> 25 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it is. We've had our good and bad times, but we're happy. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure you will. <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you're going dancing. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have tickets?   <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to go, but what about Cindy? <EOS>
<BOS> What if she finds out?  She'll be so sad. <EOS>
<BOS> Front row!  Let's tell Cindy that we have to work late. <EOS>
<BOS> Then she'll know we went to the concert. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  That's a good lie. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey David. I won't be in school next week. My family is going on vacation. <EOS>
<BOS> To Disneyland, the amusement park in California. <EOS>
<BOS> This will be my first trip. I'm excited. <EOS>
<BOS> My mom can't go on them. She has motion sickness. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to miss one week of school, so I need to do homework while I'm there. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I don't want to be behind in class. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, my parents are making me bring my books. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I won't be going to Disneyland. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Bill. My wife and I are going to buy our daughter a car. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. It's a graduation gift. <EOS>
<BOS> Used. It will be her first vehicle, so she doesn't need a brand new one. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it the red one? <EOS>
<BOS> My daughter would love that car. <EOS>
<BOS> How many miles does it have on it? And, how much do you want for it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's pretty good. Why are you selling it? <EOS>
<BOS> Congratulations on your new baby! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Can I take it for a test drive? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know how to use one? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't even know how to use your smartphone. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you should learn how to use your phone first. <EOS>
<BOS> The stock market crashed.  <EOS>
<BOS> Our stocks are worth nothing. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  The company stocks have no value. <EOS>
<BOS> What are we all going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I was going to use that to pay my son's college tuition. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have a dog. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible.   <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do when you find out who it is?  <EOS>
<BOS> They are going to be so embarrassed. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Don't be in a hurry to end negotiations. <EOS>
<BOS> If you're in a rush, you're more likely to make mistakes. <EOS>
<BOS> If you show them patience, they will think you are not under pressure to make a quick deal.  They will start to give you what you want because they think you don't need their offer. <EOS>
<BOS> Just take your time.  There's a lot of money involved, so you don't want to make any mistakes in your negotiations. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Are you remodeling your house? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea.  The layout is not very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree.  Can I get a bigger office? <EOS>
<BOS> Great! <EOS>
<BOS> Books, clothes, and shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> I love to shop online.  Shipping is fast and free. <EOS>
<BOS> I can just return them if I don't like them or they don't fit. <EOS>
<BOS> I love looking for deals without leaving home. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  It's really cool. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm thinking about getting one soon. <EOS>
<BOS> They are pretty expensive.   <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  You never answer your calls or texts. <EOS>
<BOS> You're just going to waste your money. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm making posters, Mom. Our school needs to raise money for a field trip. <EOS>
<BOS> We want to go on an overnight camping trip and the school doesn't have enough money. <EOS>
<BOS> We are going to have a car wash. <EOS>
<BOS> It's going to be at the school parking lot and the students and teachers are going to volunteer to wash cars for donations. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! I'll let my teacher know. <EOS>
<BOS> Saturday at noon. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I haven't checked. <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect weather for a car wash. <EOS>
<BOS> As many as possible. Karen and Jane are coming over to help too. <EOS>
<BOS> All over town. I hope many people see them. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> He always does that. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  But when he sees him, he acts like Greg is the greatest guy in the whole world. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sandy. I'm going hiking with some friends. Do you want join? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? It's a lot of fun and great exercise. <EOS>
<BOS> It is. You should come. <EOS>
<BOS> I have an extra pair. What size do you wear? <EOS>
<BOS> What a coincidence! Me too! <EOS>
<BOS> Comfortable clothes, a jacket, a water bottle, snacks, a flashlight, and a map. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a small backpack to put these items in? <EOS>
<BOS> We usually hike about 10 miles, but this weekend we're going to hike a much shorter distance. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Peter. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Does your younger son loan him money? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny and smart. He's like a bank. <EOS>
<BOS> This is giving him great experience. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I think more companies are hiring now. <EOS>
<BOS> Volunteer at organizations and attend the company events.  You'll meet lots of people in the same industry. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Sandy. Bill and I are going out to dinner without the kids. <EOS>
<BOS> We hired a babysitter. This will be our first time leaving the kids with a babysitter. <EOS>
<BOS> Our friend's daughter, Natalie. She is 18 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Do you know her? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you like her as a babysitter? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to hear. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I heard she has a lot of babysitting experience. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! She must be a smart girl. <EOS>
<BOS> That's awesome! <EOS>
<BOS> Now I feel a lot better about hiring her as a babysitter. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you know? <EOS>
<BOS> What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe he's just getting some advice. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but the line is usually very long. <EOS>
<BOS> Overseas to Korea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think the line will be long today? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go have lunch instead? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I'm a little nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I just don't know any of these people.  Do you have any advice for me? <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, two of our clients are taking me out for drinks the first night. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to make a good first impression. <EOS>
<BOS> What if I get nervous and drink too much. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you.  It's been a lot of fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you offering me a job? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  This would be a great business opportunity for me. <EOS>
<BOS> When do you need an answer? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I will think about it carefully and let you know by Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you feel sick? <EOS>
<BOS> You shouldn't lie down after eating. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's skip dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> It's nice.  When did you get it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a designer bag.   <EOS>
<BOS> I think I will.  I need a new bag. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  But you already bought a new bag. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's hurry before everything is sold out. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure, Cathy. Where should we have it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> I can make ham sandwiches and potato salad. <EOS>
<BOS> Tell your sisters about the picnic. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. It will be a good day for a swim in the lake. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't forget to pack your life jackets too. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course, your brother will be joining us. Where is he? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's wake him up. <EOS>
<BOS> Andy, wake up. We're going to the lake. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well, Sean. I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what it seems like. But I need a job. <EOS>
<BOS> 3 months. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm an electrician. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but that takes money. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. It's been frustrating. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't get along with my boss. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. That was my mistake. I thought it would be easy to find another job. I was wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> They're from my boyfriend. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. They're beautiful. <EOS>
<BOS> I counted 30. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to find a vase. I don't want them to die. <EOS>
<BOS> I found one. But it's too small. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. <EOS>
<BOS> I have an idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, he forgot my birthday yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  Why? <EOS>
<BOS> We already rescheduled once.  This will be the second time. <EOS>
<BOS> You've had two months to prepare for this. <EOS>
<BOS> The clients have been very patient.   <EOS>
<BOS> You have one week! <EOS>
<BOS> Are you free tonight? I need a babysitter to watch Michael. <EOS>
<BOS> We do too. Our regular babysitter is sick and the tickets are non-refundable. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful! <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you! We will pay her, of course. I know she is great with kids. I remember her playing with Michael before. He really liked her. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! She will be a good teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea! But I'm not sure Michael will like this idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, Happy New Year, Joe. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad it finally ended. I'm looking forward to a new year. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I lost my job, my car broke down, and then my cat almost died. <EOS>
<BOS> That's why I'm hoping the New Year will be much better. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I have a job interview next week. My parents loaned me money to buy a new car. My cat is on medication. The vet thinks he will make a full recovery. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. What are you looking forward to in the new year? <EOS>
<BOS> Congratulations! That's great news! The new year is going to be a wonderful one for you and Jill. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey let's start off the new year with a drink. Do you want to go grab a beer tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> It's really difficult. Are you having a hard time with it? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it number 4? <EOS>
<BOS> No. That's why I'm calling. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't come over. I'm babysitting my younger brother. <EOS>
<BOS> No, my parents said I cannot have any friends over when I'm babysitting. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What have you done so far? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I wrote some things, and then I erased it. It didn't make any sense. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you ask your parents? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's call Lucy. She's really good in math. She'll have the answer. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of comments? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is our company working with him then? <EOS>
<BOS> Our boss is wimp. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I'm trying to lose weight. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I've been running two miles every day. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  Losing weight is hard. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I would be nervous too. <EOS>
<BOS> Be confident. <EOS>
<BOS> Big, juicy burgers. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Who eats salad? <EOS>
<BOS> Salad is boring. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  That should work. <EOS>
<BOS> No way!  I want a big, juicy burger. <EOS>
<BOS> I work for a law firm. <EOS>
<BOS> I answer phones, file papers, and create spreadsheets. <EOS>
<BOS> Spreadsheets are documents created on a computer that contain all kinds of data in rows and columns. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really.  It's pretty easy.  The computer does all the calculations for you. <EOS>
<BOS> The job is ok.  But, my bosses are great. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to ask the boss for a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> I do work hard. I'm here early every day and I leave late every night. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, I've been here for 10 years. My last raise was three years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think she will say yes? <EOS>
<BOS> I wrote a short report about why I deserve a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to be prepared about everything. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'm ready to talk to her? <EOS>
<BOS> Why not? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I have a lot to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really.  I don't have a family, so I don't feel bad about working late. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have time for a social life.  I'm too busy working. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Anne. We just got back from the emergency room. <EOS>
<BOS> Jason had to get stitches. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, he was slicing some onions and the knife slipped. He got a really deep cut on his finger. <EOS>
<BOS> The painful part was waiting at the emergency room. There was only one doctor working tonight. We waited three hours. <EOS>
<BOS> The nurse wrapped it with a bandage to stop the bleeding. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  But, I knew he had to have stitches. It was a really bad cut, so we had to stay. <EOS>
<BOS> Nine. He won't be able to play video games for a few weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, it is. But he's not happy about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why are they the best? <EOS>
<BOS> Does she put a special ingredient inside? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Do we have all of the ingredients? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I can't wait to try her recipe. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Where? <EOS>
<BOS> Our boss is not going to be happy. <EOS>
<BOS> It's really funny. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you seen it? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have a sense of humor. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hey Sam. I'm going furniture shopping with my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We need a new sofa. Our old one is ripping. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you get a good deal? <EOS>
<BOS> Where did you go? <EOS>
<BOS> I saw a flyer for that in the mail. I think that's where my wife wants to go. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to know! Thanks for telling me. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We want a dark brown leather sofa. <EOS>
<BOS> Your wife and my wife must have the same taste in furniture. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Janice. I couldn't sleep. What are you doing here? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, they are. I never really paid attention to them. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a telescope, but we never use it. I may need to bring it outside one day. <EOS>
<BOS> You can borrow ours. <EOS>
<BOS> What's that? <EOS>
<BOS> That would be really interesting to study. <EOS>
<BOS> Look at the moon! It's a full moon. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I didn't notice it earlier. What a beautiful sight. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. How about 11 pm? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll bring my telescope. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds fine to me. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you having trouble with? <EOS>
<BOS> Many native English speakers have the same problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I was an English major in college. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> So what's the big deal? <EOS>
<BOS> Gloria is a great boss.   <EOS>
<BOS> She hasn't met the new CTO yet? <EOS>
<BOS> No wonder Gloria is nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to negotiate? <EOS>
<BOS> First of all, don't be afraid to ask for what you want. <EOS>
<BOS> Be willing to say no if you're not happy. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Is there something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  That happened to me too. <EOS>
<BOS> I just set a strict schedule.  Work is work and home is home. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  But if you don't do that, you're going to get sick. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I need to get rid of some things. <EOS>
<BOS> Some clothes, small appliances, and the rowing machine. <EOS>
<BOS> It was a waste of money. <EOS>
<BOS> I only used it once.   <EOS>
<BOS> The store wouldn't take it back.  It was too late. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi James. I got a new cell phone. I'm reading the manual. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I really like it. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to look at my phone? <EOS>
<BOS> Be careful with it. <EOS>
<BOS> It is very light. It has a lot of functions. <EOS>
<BOS> It was expensive. It was $100. <EOS>
<BOS> This was a gift from my parents. It was my birthday yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'm tired of reading this manual. I need a break. <EOS>
<BOS> Weren't you listening? <EOS>
<BOS> He said no one is getting a raise this year. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  The managers are all getting bonuses. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know what's going on. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck.  You may lose your job. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> It's explained in the report. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll try to explain it better for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I hear they have really good food especially their omelets. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I heard the same thing from Janet. She waited an hour for a table. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to make breakfast at home? <EOS>
<BOS> I'd like a ham and cheese omelet. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, we only need eggs, ham, and cheese. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about a vegetable omelet? <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know how to make an omelet. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's just go to the new diner. <EOS>
<BOS> Your ex-girlfriend? <EOS>
<BOS> She's back in town? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to see her again? <EOS>
<BOS> What did she say? <EOS>
<BOS> Ask Sue if she keeps in touch with Karen, my ex-girlfriend. <EOS>
<BOS> That's wonderful, Jane! What did she study? <EOS>
<BOS> She must be so proud of her. <EOS>
<BOS> Does she want to work in a hospital? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! <EOS>
<BOS> We bought her a new car. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. Her current car is so old. We want her to have a reliable car since she will be working late hours. <EOS>
<BOS> When does she start working? <EOS>
<BOS> What is she going to do for a month? <EOS>
<BOS> How fun! She's an adult now. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. <EOS>
<BOS> Both of us are sick? <EOS>
<BOS> I feel bad about lying, but I really don't want to go to her party. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't feel like it. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to watch movies in my pajamas. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll go for an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Joan. I just got my report card. <EOS>
<BOS> I was hoping to get a good grade in Science class, but I didn't. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I did well in all of my other classes, but that one. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But I want to be a scientist. So, this is discouraging to me. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for your encouragement. How did you do? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you do in your math class? <EOS>
<BOS> How about science? <EOS>
<BOS> What does ok mean? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm happy for you. But I'm sad for myself again. <EOS>
<BOS> Why Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't want to go. <EOS>
<BOS> But it hurt last time. <EOS>
<BOS> But I brush my teeth every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I don't have any cavities this time. <EOS>
<BOS> What time are you picking me up? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll tell my teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll see you later. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work. <EOS>
<BOS> Three? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. What about riding your bike to work? <EOS>
<BOS> You can carpool with someone. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work with anyone who lives near you? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you want to ride with your boss? <EOS>
<BOS> My class has to write an essay about where we want to go on our field trip. <EOS>
<BOS> My class can't decide where we want to go, so our teacher is going to make it a contest. <EOS>
<BOS> Half of my class wants to go to the museum. The other half wants to go to the zoo. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to go to the zoo because I want to see a lion. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but it was so much fun. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But I want to see animals. <EOS>
<BOS> Airplanes? I really like airplanes too. <EOS>
<BOS> Now I can't decide. I need to really think about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you meet a lot of people? <EOS>
<BOS> Were they helpful? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great to hear.  Networking can be scary. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'm not in a hurry. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.     <EOS>
<BOS> It's a lovely city.  I just don't like the rain. <EOS>
<BOS> Daniel, are we talking about this again? <EOS>
<BOS> Having a dog is a big responsibility. <EOS>
<BOS> You have to walk him, feed him, bathe him, clean his messes, and play with him. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to talk to your mom first. <EOS>
<BOS> It's because she is afraid of them. <EOS>
<BOS> She was bitten by a dog when she was a child. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. But I was old enough to help take care of him. <EOS>
<BOS> Ten years old. <EOS>
<BOS> It's all over the news. <EOS>
<BOS> All of our customers' personal information was stolen. <EOS>
<BOS> Our information was stolen too. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to buy a birthday present for my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. <EOS>
<BOS> All of those things sound nice. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know that either. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. <EOS>
<BOS> Red. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect. I'll take it. <EOS>
<BOS> It was last week. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you do here, Michael? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm Antonio Johnson, the General Manager of the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like Sales, Michael? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a business card, Michael? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's have a lunch meeting some time.  We can discuss your future at this company. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really.  It's boring. <EOS>
<BOS> It's always the same stuff <EOS>
<BOS> Then you can tell me what's going on since I don't watch, read or listen to the news. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with your English now? <EOS>
<BOS> You know most of the words. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you're reading very difficult books. <EOS>
<BOS> I have so much to do! <EOS>
<BOS> Because I have two jobs and I go to school part-time!   <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I just have a lot of stress. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really.  It's just work and school stuff.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Let's get dinner together next weekend.   <EOS>
<BOS> We always hang out at the coffee shop.  Let's do something else. <EOS>
<BOS> I do, but today I want to do something different. <EOS>
<BOS> How about this?  We will go to the coffee shop and have a cup of coffee and talk for a while.  After that, we will take a stroll around the lake. <EOS>
<BOS> But you are buying the coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you gossiping again? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  You're gossiping. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I think it's rude to talk about other people. <EOS>
<BOS> Gossip can hurt people. <EOS>
<BOS> Try to put yourself in their shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm getting laid off. <EOS>
<BOS> He said the company is restructuring and they don't need my position anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I just bought a house. <EOS>
<BOS> They offered me a severance package. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck, Lou. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm waiting for the bus. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great!  I think I missed the bus. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Linda.  I'll buy you a cup of coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  Let's reschedule when your husband is fully recovered. <EOS>
<BOS> I have so much work to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, almost every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  My wife is not happy about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  I'm going on a business trip today. <EOS>
<BOS> San Francisco, our corporate headquarters. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, all of the top management. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure!  When is it? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not.  I have to go to my sister's birthday party. <EOS>
<BOS> The party is at 5 o'clock.   <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds good.  The party will be over before 10. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Thanks for inviting me.   <EOS>
<BOS> I'd like to order your daily special. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess non-spicy.  I've never been asked that before. <EOS>
<BOS> Rice?  Is this Max's Pizza Place? <EOS>
<BOS> I thought I was ordering pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds good.  I'll take one order to go with white rice. <EOS>
<BOS> Is the price on this television flexible? <EOS>
<BOS> I can show you their website on my phone. <EOS>
<BOS> Here is the exact television with a cheaper price. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  Thank you! <EOS>
<BOS> What time do I start work?  <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a single dad.  I need to take my son to school by 8 AM.  Would I be able to start at 9? <EOS>
<BOS> Please consider my situation.  It's hard to be a single dad and have a career. <EOS>
<BOS> You are? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much!  I look forward to hearing from you. <EOS>
<BOS> When do you need to go? <EOS>
<BOS> Can it be a non-direct flight? <EOS>
<BOS> There is one direct flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7 AM.  It's $100 more expensive.   <EOS>
<BOS> When will you be returning? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Can you afford to quit? <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. <EOS>
<BOS> What does it mean? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awesome.  I wish I could do that. <EOS>
<BOS> I can help you with that. <EOS>
<BOS> We can give you a discount depending on how much you order per month. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I see your order history. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know if I can do that.  I will talk to my manager and get back to you. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand.  I will call you back as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Mark. What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> How did he steal it? <EOS>
<BOS> Did the boss call the police? <EOS>
<BOS> Why not? <EOS>
<BOS> What if he doesn't return the money. <EOS>
<BOS> He better return the money. <EOS>
<BOS> I always thought there was something strange about him. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. How can anyone trust him after this? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's take a cruise. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> You shouldn't say that.  That's bad luck. <EOS>
<BOS> You won't be swimming in the ocean. <EOS>
<BOS> You are being silly.  Let's just stay in a hotel with a pool. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Where? <EOS>
<BOS> I was just there an hour ago. <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary!  I hope no one gets hurt. <EOS>
<BOS> What about the hostages? <EOS>
<BOS> No thanks.  I have too much work to do. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I really can't go this time. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Can you close my door please? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to buy my wife an anniversary gift. <EOS>
<BOS> It was yesterday! <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect.  I will take them. <EOS>
<BOS> No, Jason. What rumors? <EOS>
<BOS> When? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are they laying people off? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you worried? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm really worried too. My wife and I just had a baby. Also, I haven't been at this company for very long. I would be the first one to get laid off. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we should start looking for other jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, if you heard it from Susan, it must be true. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the recall? <EOS>
<BOS> That is extremely dangerous. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think the company can survive. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you should look for another job. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I'm really busy today. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to visit my parents. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yeah.  What time do you need help? <EOS>
<BOS> When? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry, but my car is in the shop. <EOS>
<BOS> A couple of days. <EOS>
<BOS> What's interesting? <EOS>
<BOS> You did?  I'm sorry I lied.  I just hate morning traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> It's normal to be nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to get him a car? <EOS>
<BOS> Did your auto insurance go up a lot? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> When will that be? <EOS>
<BOS> Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Is it a cold? <EOS>
<BOS> My son, Billy, was sick last week too. He missed four days of school. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a virus going around. We need to stay healthy too. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! I think I'll buy some today. Do you need anything at the store? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. What do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! I'll drop it off on my way home. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! I'm going to go to the store after lunch. I will be at your house around 2 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Is that tonight, Beth? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I've been so busy with school exams, I completely forgot. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Thanks for reminding me. I have one more test at 5 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> I forgot that too. What should I get her? Do you have any suggestions? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you buy her? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have time to go shopping. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. When is your birthday, so I don't forget? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry! I forgot yours too. I'm a bad friend. <EOS>
<BOS> No.   <EOS>
<BOS> Three weeks ago. <EOS>
<BOS> I did.  I sent him a follow-up email one week later. <EOS>
<BOS> No.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Bill made many promises he didn't keep. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  I love this house. <EOS>
<BOS> We raised four kids in this house. <EOS>
<BOS> There would be no memories in a new house. <EOS>
<BOS> I really don't want to move, Carl. <EOS>
<BOS> No, what happened, Tom? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? Who? <EOS>
<BOS> What did Mrs. Jones do? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! He's going to be in big trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think they are going to suspend him from school? <EOS>
<BOS> Not only Mrs. Jones, but other teachers too. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, Cathy. It's the day we honor working Americans. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Back in the late 1800's, many Americans were working long hours under poor conditions.  People protested to have better working conditions and a special holiday was created for workers. In 1894, Labor Day became a national holiday. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Many businesses close and companies let people take a day off. Post offices and banks are closed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Schools are not open on this day either. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. It's always the first Monday in September. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, now it's also celebrated as the end of summer. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Some places even have fireworks and parades. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, Cathy. One day you will also be a hard-working American. <EOS>
<BOS> Again? We went there last weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> But grandma's food tastes weird. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I love them. But she always makes the same dish, chicken pot pie. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, Mom. Sorry for being rude. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! Can we get ice cream? <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, that's funny. <EOS>
<BOS> Sundaes on Sundays. <EOS>
<BOS> Grandpa will love it. He loves ice cream too. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sarah. Yeah, it's sunny and clear. I think we're going to take our boat out. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you and Paul like to join us? <EOS>
<BOS> Great! We can pack a lunch and eat on the boat. <EOS>
<BOS> You haven't? Do you get seasick? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you get airsick? Do you have any kind of motion sickness? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. Then you'll probably be ok on the boat. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes and there is a reason why. <EOS>
<BOS> Tom and I took my friend out on our boat once and she got very sick. I felt terrible for her. <EOS>
<BOS> What about Paul? <EOS>
<BOS> I'd rather stay at the pool.   <EOS>
<BOS> To play in the sand. <EOS>
<BOS> Stop complaining.  It's not that bad. <EOS>
<BOS> I like this show.  Give it a chance. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a musical.  There's supposed to be singing. <EOS>
<BOS> I like musicals.  Are you going to continue complaining? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  That's a deal.  Now, stop complaining.   <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sally. My dad is not in the audience. He's not coming for my first piano recital. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. I really wanted him to be here today. <EOS>
<BOS> He missed my ballet performance last week too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He has a lot of projects at work. <EOS>
<BOS> He's an architect. He designs buildings and houses. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He's really good at his job. That's why he is so busy. <EOS>
<BOS> What, Sally? <EOS>
<BOS> He's here! <EOS>
<BOS> My grandmother makes the best cookies. <EOS>
<BOS> She puts a secret ingredient in it. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know because it's a secret. <EOS>
<BOS> Welcome to the company, Carl.  I'm Robert.  I'm the head of Operations. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Contact me if your customers have any technical issues. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.   Let's have a drink after work some time. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure, Lisa. I'm glad you asked me. I don't have a partner. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't today. It's my grandmother's 80th birthday and we're taking her out to dinner. How about tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> I can meet on Thursday too. Do you want to come to my house? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We can walk together. My house is very close to school. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a good plan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'm pretty good at drawing. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. My parents are artists. They taught me how to draw at an early age. <EOS>
<BOS> I can teach you. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. This is going to be fun. We make a good team. <EOS>
<BOS> It was lovely, Barbara. The rooms were spacious and clean. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate. <EOS>
<BOS> The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna. <EOS>
<BOS> The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a shuttle bus that takes you to the downtown area where all of the shops and restaurants are. It was very convenient. <EOS>
<BOS> The concierge was very helpful and the front desk clerks were very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> It was. I would recommend this place to everyone. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. They have great food. It's a little expensive, but very delicious. They have a fantastic breakfast buffet every morning too. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't wait to go back. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> No, thank you.  I don't like mushrooms. <EOS>
<BOS> They taste weird and they have a strange texture. <EOS>
<BOS> Feels like a sponge in my mouth. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess I will get something to eat later. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  I worked really hard on it. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope the CEO was impressed. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to hear.  It's scary to give a presentation in front of the head of the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm getting a little hungry. <EOS>
<BOS> Burgers and fries? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is the drive-thru line so long? <EOS>
<BOS> It might be busier inside? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's head to another place. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we should be able to find one that's not too crowded. <EOS>
<BOS> But not very healthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hi Joe. I'm looking for some materials to make a solar system. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, David has a science project. He has to make a model of the solar system with the sun and the planets. <EOS>
<BOS> I was looking for some foam balls, but I can't find any in our garage. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! David wants to paint them and glue them on a black poster board. <EOS>
<BOS> Was Judy in Mrs. Johnson's science class? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there eight or nine planets now? When I was a child, Pluto was a planet. But it's not considered a major planet anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you! I'll keep looking in my garage too. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too! But, why do we have that day off? <EOS>
<BOS> No. Why, Sam? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> I see. Is it always in May? <EOS>
<BOS> I just thought it was another day off from school. I'm glad to know what this day means now. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you do anything special on this day? <EOS>
<BOS> I've never been to a cemetery before. Is it scary? <EOS>
<BOS> Do all schools close on this day. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for telling me what Memorial Day means. I'm going to go home and ask my brother if he knows. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you think is going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe they're going to lay people off instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Your hunch may be right. <EOS>
<BOS> They are so busy with sports. <EOS>
<BOS> Jenny plays softball and Luke plays baseball. <EOS>
<BOS> There are games every weekend.   <EOS>
<BOS> It is so much fun to watch and cheer the teams on. <EOS>
<BOS> Time is too short. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to take our clients out to dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions? <EOS>
<BOS> The new one on Main Street? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't take them there.   <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you hear? The weather report is predicting heavy rain and severe flooding in our area. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm heading to the store to buy sandbags. <EOS>
<BOS> To stop the water from entering my house. You should do the same thing. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't do that. I need to stay here with all of my animals. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I need to make sure they are safe. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great. Aren't you worried at all? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I'm not risking it this time. <EOS>
<BOS> You should be. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't you go back to school later? <EOS>
<BOS> But you're successful without a college degree. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not too late to get your degree. <EOS>
<BOS> What did you get him last year? <EOS>
<BOS> What does he want this year? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  He has expensive taste. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm designing a logo. <EOS>
<BOS> We're launching a new brand of shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> Children. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't feel like going out tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I'm just really tired today. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you call one of your friends? <EOS>
<BOS> I ordered a table a few weeks ago, but it still has not arrived. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Unfortunately, I lost them both. <EOS>
<BOS> Here is both my address and phone number. <EOS>
<BOS> So, what will you do about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for your wonderful customer service. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know what happened. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you blaming me? <EOS>
<BOS> I knew you would blame me. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Billy. Where? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a lot of fun. Marine animals are your favorite. <EOS>
<BOS> When is the field trip? <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. Let me check my schedule first. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I love going to the aquarium. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I just looked at my calendar. I'm free that day. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, now it's time to do your homework. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. But you still need to do your homework. <EOS>
<BOS> We're not done with the project. <EOS>
<BOS> You haven't done your share of the work. <EOS>
<BOS> The project is due tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  Where are you? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want me to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you crazy?  I didn't prepare for the presentation. <EOS>
<BOS> What am I supposed to tell the clients and our boss? <EOS>
<BOS> This is the last time I'm covering for you! <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  I lost 30 pounds. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't eat any junk food and I work out every day. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go to the gym with me? <EOS>
<BOS> I go every morning at 5 AM. <EOS>
<BOS> Once you get started, you'll really enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> What did you do? <EOS>
<BOS> Why does she think that? <EOS>
<BOS> You didn't make yourself very clear.  You need to act more professional.   <EOS>
<BOS> I think I should take it to the dry cleaners. <EOS>
<BOS> You should be more careful with it. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  Let's ask them. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not too late. <EOS>
<BOS> Why not?  Lots of people go back to school. <EOS>
<BOS> That's why you go back to school.  You get to learn everything over again. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to the pet store. <EOS>
<BOS> I got a dog this morning.  I need to buy some pet supplies. <EOS>
<BOS> A Labrador Retriever puppy. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  We used to have many dogs when I was a child. <EOS>
<BOS> I need a leash, two dog bowls, and some treats. <EOS>
<BOS> My boyfriend. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll make it short. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you been listening to me? <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Dad. Yeah, I'm just a little sad that we are selling my childhood home. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. I just have a lot of memories here. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you remember all of our holiday parties here? Everyone came to our house. <EOS>
<BOS> Now I'm married and have a family of my own. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know who bought our house? <EOS>
<BOS> Where will you and mom go? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. Will there be enough room when the grandchildren visit? <EOS>
<BOS> Where's Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> Ann does not work here anymore.   <EOS>
<BOS> She moved out of the state last month.   <EOS>
<BOS> Jane is a great stylist. <EOS>
<BOS> She has an opening tomorrow at 4 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> You will love Jane. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I just got it yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. Green is my favorite color. <EOS>
<BOS> I love it. It has great gas mileage and it has lot of cool features. <EOS>
<BOS> The sunroof. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. My cousin is a car salesman, so he helped me out. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course, that's his job. And, he would love the commission. <EOS>
<BOS> Downtown. I can go with you when you're ready to buy a car. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I don't think I can go out to dinner for a while. <EOS>
<BOS> I better learn how to cook. <EOS>
<BOS> There are always chores to do. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. There are a couple of loads of laundry that need to be done. <EOS>
<BOS> They need to be washed, folded, and put away. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me know if you want more to do after that. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm curious. What are you saving up for? <EOS>
<BOS> I promise. <EOS>
<BOS> That's very sweet of you. He would love it! <EOS>
<BOS> You're a good kid, Alan. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, it was fun. I made a new friend. <EOS>
<BOS> Her name is Cindy. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she's a new student. She moved here from Seattle, Washington. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much. <EOS>
<BOS> Cindy and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we, Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. They don't have any friends here, yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's eat out.  We haven't eaten out in two months. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go to our favorite restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> No, the Chinese place. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you mean have a clothing and shoe line under the same brand name? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok!  Let's get started on it. <EOS>
<BOS> What about tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> There's a new Chinese restaurant downtown. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think we should make reservations. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we invite anyone else? <EOS>
<BOS> Lisa is out of town. Let's invite Cathy and Sharon. <EOS>
<BOS> Noon? <EOS>
<BOS> Good. I'll call Cathy and Sharon right now. <EOS>
<BOS> If they can't, I'll let you know. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  You already borrowed money from me last week. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what you said last time. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  You need to find a job. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, Sam. Why don't you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> You have a lot of cousins. <EOS>
<BOS> So, you could entertain them. <EOS>
<BOS> It is going to be at an Italian restaurant. Italian food is your favorite. <EOS>
<BOS> Probably a few hours. <EOS>
<BOS> If you can find a ride home, you can leave early. <EOS>
<BOS> You will learn someday. But tonight you are going to the reunion. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  He's talking to the vice-president of the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you crazy?  They won't know you. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck.   <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let me know how the conversation goes. <EOS>
<BOS> No, thanks.  I'm too nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Helen. Stan and I are taking a trip to the Bahamas. <EOS>
<BOS> It's was our anniversary yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> 30 years. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. We've been planning this trip for years. But he surprised me with the tickets last night. <EOS>
<BOS> We're leaving in a couple of weeks. I can't wait. This is the best anniversary present. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. That's so kind of you. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! What can I bring tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well.  Bill is a tough negotiator. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't want to compromise on anything. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to walk away.  He's not the only tough person in the room. <EOS>
<BOS> Did anyone get hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> Have they caught the robbers? <EOS>
<BOS> We better lock our doors. <EOS>
<BOS> How much do they want to offer? <EOS>
<BOS> I will contact my client and see if she will accept the offer. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to know.  My client wants a nice young family to buy her house.  She lived there with her husband for 40 years until he passed away. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm thinking about throwing her a going-away party. What do you think? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to help me plan it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. Less stress if I don't have to cook. <EOS>
<BOS> How about all of the people she works with. How many is that? <EOS>
<BOS> Should we keep it a secret or let her know? <EOS>
<BOS> When should we have the party? <EOS>
<BOS> Next month, I think. <EOS>
<BOS> How about next Friday? It's her last day at work too. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with her current phone? <EOS>
<BOS> Why does she want a smart phone? <EOS>
<BOS> She can't do that with her flip phone? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you think she's too young for social media and smart phones? <EOS>
<BOS> You're more understanding than I am. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm going to rent a car. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I found a great deal for a rental car. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Is there something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I will try to clean up more often. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I promise to clean up my mess, do my dishes, and take turns vacuuming. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Bill. I'm going to make a coffee table for Jill. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We just got back from furniture shopping and the price of furniture is expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right. Furniture is too expensive these days. <EOS>
<BOS> My dad used to make furniture when he was younger. He taught me a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I built a desk for my daughter when she was in college. She still has it. <EOS>
<BOS> It depends on what kind of desk you want. Show me a picture later. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe I should quit being an accountant and go into furniture making instead. <EOS>
<BOS> You earn one week of paid vacation after you've been at the company for one year. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a medical situation? <EOS>
<BOS> You can take one week off with your supervisor's approval, but it will not be a paid week. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Is there something wrong with your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  You just got it fixed last month. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need a ride anywhere else? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I need to go to the store and the bank too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  She works fast too. <EOS>
<BOS> I think she wants to move up the company quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> She's a great worker. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know what she wants to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's my job! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I'm on hold. <EOS>
<BOS> Not right now.  I'm trying to get a free upgrade on my rental car. <EOS>
<BOS> The rental car agent is talking to her supervisor right now. <EOS>
<BOS> I told the agent that our company does a lot of business with this rental company. <EOS>
<BOS> Kyle, hold on.  The agent is back on the phone. <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you eat lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Are trying to lose weight? <EOS>
<BOS> She is right.   <EOS>
<BOS> What did you have for lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> What else did you have for lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that.   <EOS>
<BOS> I will have red roses delivered to her as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> Please keep them since we made the error. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope your wife enjoys both flower bouquets. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> How did he answer you? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you ask him? <EOS>
<BOS> He's not a morning person. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you're right. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like me to go with you? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Do you want to have lunch together afterwards? <EOS>
<BOS> How about tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> You pick the restaurant. It will be my treat since you're having a bad day. <EOS>
<BOS> My pleasure. Let's go check out the phone store. <EOS>
<BOS> What are company perks? <EOS>
<BOS> What are your favorite perks?  <EOS>
<BOS> We have a pension plan?  That is rare these days.  <EOS>
<BOS> Next month. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! <EOS>
<BOS> Three months. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of procedure? <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That should help. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's important to have dental insurance. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  I love them. <EOS>
<BOS> But e-books are so convenient. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good point. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  There was a lot of traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I left too late. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll try next time. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> What can I say? <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't hear my alarm clock. <EOS>
<BOS> I went to sleep very late. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I was at a party last night. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's check to see we have everything we need. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll make sure we have enough food and water. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  Let's head downstairs soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> They're already down there. <EOS>
<BOS> Lisa, you definitely deserve a promotion. You are too qualified for this job. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a lot of experience and you're very good with people. You should be a manager. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you worried about? <EOS>
<BOS> But you have lots of experience. You have more experience than some of the current managers. <EOS>
<BOS> I know they are. Did you ever think about going back to school and getting your degree? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. When I'm not at work, I'm spending time with my family. Life is so busy these days for many people. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a lot of work too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Lee. I'm setting up tables and chairs for a family BBQ. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow is the fourth of July. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know. It's our country's Independence Day. <EOS>
<BOS> On July 4, 1776, our country's founders declared independence from the rulers of Great Britain. <EOS>
<BOS> We went to war against Great Britain called the Revolutionary War and won. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. So, now the United States celebrates this day every year. <EOS>
<BOS> We usually have a big BBQ party. Then we light fireworks when it gets dark. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Would you like to come over and watch them with our family? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. They will enjoy them. But it is very dangerous, so we have to watch the kids carefully. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you know it is me? <EOS>
<BOS> I am sorry.  I will pick it up next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'm very sorry again. <EOS>
<BOS> I will never do it again. <EOS>
<BOS> That was quick. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  That would be great! <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  What day is good for you? <EOS>
<BOS> Wednesday at noon is perfect for me. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I play two instruments. I play the piano and violin? <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know how to play any instruments? <EOS>
<BOS> I took piano and violin lessons when I was a child. <EOS>
<BOS> 10 years. <EOS>
<BOS> My mom wanted me to go to a music college, but I wanted to be a doctor. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. What instrument do you want to learn? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could, but I don't have time. <EOS>
<BOS> What can they do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's horrible. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are they going to stay tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't they stay with us, too? They can come here after things settle down. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, they will never forget. But hopefully, they will be able to move on. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry. I know this must be very difficult for you and your parents. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe a wildfire can destroy everything so quickly. It's just terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> Is anyone helping them pack? <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  I was just watching the news and they didn't mention that. <EOS>
<BOS> How did he die? <EOS>
<BOS> That's sad.  I still don't see anything about it on the news. <EOS>
<BOS> Where did you read this? <EOS>
<BOS> Michelle!  It's a hoax.  The news just announced that it was a fake story.   <EOS>
<BOS> Let's get a sports car. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  All of the kids are out of the house now.  We don't need a big car anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> But I've always wanted a sports car. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  My boss asked me to finish this project one week early. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I have other deadlines to meet too. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'll just work all weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm an architect. <EOS>
<BOS> I studied construction management in college. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been interested in working on the construction side. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I send you my resume? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you!  I look forward to meeting with you again. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you crazy?  Motorcycles are dangerous. <EOS>
<BOS> I really wish you would not get one. <EOS>
<BOS> I would be worried all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you heard from any of them? <EOS>
<BOS> What did they say to you at the event? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know why they make promises they can't keep. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well.   <EOS>
<BOS> I can't eat sugar but, I love things with sugar. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  It's torture. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you lose weight last year? <EOS>
<BOS> What is a no-fat diet? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds worse than the no-sugar diet. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> That is so rude.  What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea!  Then, you can bag it up and deliver it to their house. <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you taking the stairs? <EOS>
<BOS> How long has it been broken? <EOS>
<BOS> You live on the 8th floor! <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe it's time to buy a new one. <EOS>
<BOS> It costs more money to fix every month. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go shopping for a new dishwasher today. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to Florida with some friends. Do you want to join us, Rick? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me know later. We're going to leave on Friday at 3 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> My parents own a beach house. They said I could invite a few friends. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm inviting four people including you. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. They want to be there just in case there is an emergency. <EOS>
<BOS> Clothes, swimsuit, and a surfboard. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you can rent one at the beach. Do you know how to surf? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. It's going to be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is. <EOS>
<BOS> Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm learning that now. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could, but it's a little complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> The mechanic is my brother-in-law. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you practice your presentation? <EOS>
<BOS> You can practice with me too. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course.  What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like fun.  Let's get started. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea!  Let me cancel my golf game. <EOS>
<BOS> If you order an e-book, you can get it instantly. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> E-books have pages. <EOS>
<BOS> E-books can be read in the dark.   <EOS>
<BOS> You'll never change. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I have a lunch meeting with the boss today. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We're going to discuss my raise. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  I'll need it. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you have investments? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm too scared to invest my money. <EOS>
<BOS> Good.   <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have time.  I need to make a phone call.   <EOS>
<BOS> It's important.  It can't wait.   <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> We are a small company. We can't afford paid vacations. <EOS>
<BOS> How? <EOS>
<BOS> You have a point, but we cannot afford it. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree, but I don't make the rules. <EOS>
<BOS> Cindy doesn't want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> I know. She thinks it's for babies. <EOS>
<BOS> She said Halloween is boring. <EOS>
<BOS> Then she has to wait another year. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you and Janice going? <EOS>
<BOS> We live in an apartment. Maybe that's why it's boring. There aren't many kids here. <EOS>
<BOS> What a great idea! Thanks! <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Karen. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a great idea. Have you checked the weather? <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect for an outdoor party. <EOS>
<BOS> I can help you. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you thought of what you want to serve? <EOS>
<BOS> I can bake a cake for you. <EOS>
<BOS> It would be my pleasure. <EOS>
<BOS> No. It is my gift to Bobby. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything else I can help you with? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me know if there is anything else you need. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been going to ESL classes at night. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you.  I have a question to ask you.   <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to go on a date? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I would be nervous too. <EOS>
<BOS> You're smart.  Don't worry. <EOS>
<BOS> At least it's a phone call.  She can't see you. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh.  Just look confident. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  On Mondays through Thursdays, we have to wear business attire. <EOS>
<BOS> On Fridays, we can dress casually. <EOS>
<BOS> You can wear jeans and t-shirts, but not shorts.   <EOS>
<BOS> No. When did it open? <EOS>
<BOS> Was it crowded? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you have fun? <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't know it was open yet. I will have to take my son soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Are the tickets expensive? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we'll go this weekend. We don't have any plans on Saturday. My son has been asking about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other tips? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I assumed that. Now I have to convince my husband to go. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters. That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son. <EOS>
<BOS> When is her birthday? <EOS>
<BOS> What time is dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> You only have two hours to find her a birthday present. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a gift shop in our lobby. <EOS>
<BOS> Remember the gift shop closes at 5 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to get her? <EOS>
<BOS> What about that new handbag she wants? <EOS>
<BOS> I can loan you some money. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Are you? <EOS>
<BOS> He isn't a very nice person and he's a mean boss. <EOS>
<BOS> Weren't you in a car accident that morning. <EOS>
<BOS> He would yell at people for unnecessary reasons. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I think his secretary, Mary, is planning it. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe she is happy he is leaving, so she wants to have a party. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we should. <EOS>
<BOS> What is a sad way to retire? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. Maybe we should go to the party and say goodbye. <EOS>
<BOS> Who won? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could've seen it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not the same. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Jim. My family and I planned a trip to Hawaii and I'm not sure I can go now. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a big presentation due soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. The airline tickets are non-refundable and my family is going to be very sad. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know if I can. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but he's been sick. <EOS>
<BOS> He's not very understanding. He just wants the work to be completed. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not a vacation. But I may have to do that. My wife is not going to be happy. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Do you know anything about presentations? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  She's very enthusiastic. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  She is just ambitious. <EOS>
<BOS> I think you're being paranoid. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to.  When? <EOS>
<BOS> I have work this Friday evening. <EOS>
<BOS> Saturday sounds great! <EOS>
<BOS> I am hungry too.   <EOS>
<BOS> I am going to have a hamburger and French fries. <EOS>
<BOS> The food here is delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Betty. Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out. <EOS>
<BOS> I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house. <EOS>
<BOS> I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess. <EOS>
<BOS> But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate? <EOS>
<BOS> Who? <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car? <EOS>
<BOS> At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper. <EOS>
<BOS> It's supposed to be ready this afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent. <EOS>
<BOS> They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, hi Sally. I have a job interview today. <EOS>
<BOS> At the bank. I'm applying for a teller position. <EOS>
<BOS> Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to. I just hope I don't mess up. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'm just afraid that I won't be able to answer their questions. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I just need to relax. <EOS>
<BOS> In an hour. I better leave soon. I don't want to be late. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. Thanks for your advice and encouragement. I feel much better. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  What time? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Just let me know his airline and arrival time. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know anything about computers? <EOS>
<BOS> My computer is running really slow. I don't know what's going on. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. But it's still slow. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think so. I scanned it for viruses. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Maybe it's time to get a new computer. This one is really old. <EOS>
<BOS> Ten years? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you're right. I guess it's time to buy a new one. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. I'll be right over. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing much Phil. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! What time does the game start? <EOS>
<BOS> How much is the ticket? <EOS>
<BOS> That's really nice of you. <EOS>
<BOS> You're going to drive, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, let's have dinner before we go. That will be my treat. <EOS>
<BOS> There's a great steak house near the arena. Do you want to go there? <EOS>
<BOS> Cool! Thanks for inviting me. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a few minutes before they close. <EOS>
<BOS> They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Tom. No, I'm not. I'm babysitting a neighbor's kid. <EOS>
<BOS> From 5 pm to 9 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm babysitting again next Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a good way to make money. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I love kids. They're fun to play with. <EOS>
<BOS> You're so funny. You would make a terrible babysitter. <EOS>
<BOS> Dogs are noisy and they smell weird too. <EOS>
<BOS> You're silly. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow night. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! I'll see you then. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?   <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That would make me nervous too. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you should definitely bring your laptop and tablet.   <EOS>
<BOS> Bring a nice suit.    <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you better go shopping then. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school? <EOS>
<BOS> I like pretzels and potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I go to the market with you? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to take break. I've been studying all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we get ice cream on the way home? <EOS>
<BOS> I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  It's 90 degrees right now. <EOS>
<BOS> How much higher is it than usual? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That is high.  Can we afford that? <EOS>
<BOS> But, it's been so hot these days. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I will be able to handle that. <EOS>
<BOS> No, what's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  They've been married for 30 years. <EOS>
<BOS> That is awful! <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Karen. I have so many things to do today. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to do several loads of laundry, vacuum the whole house, and clean the kitchen. <EOS>
<BOS> My mother-in-law is coming tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> She likes a very neat and tidy house. <EOS>
<BOS> I should've started a few days ago, but I was so busy at work. <EOS>
<BOS> He did help me. He mowed the lawn, cleaned all of the bathrooms, and set up the guest room yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> I also have to go grocery shopping. <EOS>
<BOS> No, that's ok. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Could you go grocery shopping for me? I already made my shopping list. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! I really appreciate it. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> Try to reboot the computer and the printer. <EOS>
<BOS> I see the problem.  Your printer is out of ink. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  But I have plans for my future. <EOS>
<BOS> I plan to work hard and ask for a promotion. <EOS>
<BOS> I plan to become a manager in two years and a director in 5 years. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you think it will go? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want some advice? <EOS>
<BOS> Make sure you do your homework. <EOS>
<BOS> Collect as much information before negotiation starts, so you know your options. <EOS>
<BOS> The more info you have, the smarter you will look. <EOS>
<BOS> I feel like I do all of the cleaning.  I clean up your mess too. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't we divide the housework? <EOS>
<BOS> We will clean up our own messes.  Then, we will take turns cleaning the common areas. <EOS>
<BOS> Places that we use together, like the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. <EOS>
<BOS> It was very high. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to keep it off. <EOS>
<BOS> My neighbor was having a party until 4 AM. <EOS>
<BOS> He was playing loud music. <EOS>
<BOS> I rang his doorbell, but he never answered the door. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to call the apartment manager if it happens again. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's just a hunch. <EOS>
<BOS> She never returns my calls anymore and she's always busy. <EOS>
<BOS> When did you hurt your back? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a lot of homework? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  It's supposed to be a big party. <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you so behind? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need help studying? <EOS>
<BOS> You still need to eat or you won't have energy for the test. <EOS>
<BOS> Fast food? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not healthy for you. Let me make you something to eat. <EOS>
<BOS> You never have the time to eat a proper meal anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me pack you some fruits. <EOS>
<BOS> But you won't do it. <EOS>
<BOS> Eat something nutritious! <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a lot to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Do your kids help too. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! But why is it called spring cleaning? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. I think we're going to start doing this too. Our house is so cluttered. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! I'm going to tell my family about this. <EOS>
<BOS> Bye, Jill. Thanks for the cleaning tip. <EOS>
<BOS> I saw you do it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  You are lying about stealing. <EOS>
<BOS> Tonight.   <EOS>
<BOS> It is my wedding anniversary and I would really like to wear this dress. <EOS>
<BOS> I am desperate.  I will pay extra. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much!  I will tell all of my friends about this place. <EOS>
<BOS> I told her I didn't know. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  She probably thinks I have no goals for my future. <EOS>
<BOS> That is my plan. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. <EOS>
<BOS> I got nervous and couldn't talk. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I need someone to pick up a client from the airport on Saturday. <EOS>
<BOS> He says he has to visit his parents this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you busy this Saturday? <EOS>
<BOS> I see.  I will talk to you later then. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I haven't been there yet. <EOS>
<BOS> What do your kids like there? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, my children would love those. They like anything with chocolate. <EOS>
<BOS> I may want to try that. I'm getting hungry now. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to join us on Saturday morning? <EOS>
<BOS> We have church in the morning, but we are free around 10 am. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's meet on Sunday at 10 am at the restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> How long will she be gone? <EOS>
<BOS> That's all?  That's so short. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it paid maternity leave? <EOS>
<BOS> Four. <EOS>
<BOS> They are so good. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I have just one more, please? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I won't. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm just worried because our company really needs this contract. <EOS>
<BOS> I won't.  I'll look tough too. <EOS>
<BOS> I am nervous! <EOS>
<BOS> He is so underrated.   <EOS>
<BOS> I think it is because he's not very handsome. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe it is because he always plays the bad guy.  People like good guys. <EOS>
<BOS> That is what makes him a great actor. <EOS>
<BOS> We are laying you off. <EOS>
<BOS> The company is restructuring and we're getting rid of your position. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow is the deadline. <EOS>
<BOS> Your co-workers always have to do your work. <EOS>
<BOS> You just don't care.  You never help the team. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you share of the work! <EOS>
<BOS> My friend, Jane, is an artist. She's displaying her work there. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? I didn't know that. My friend is a sculptor. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to come with me tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> She is going to be displaying her work all week. Would you like to go tomorrow night? <EOS>
<BOS> I can introduce you to her. She always loves talking to people about art. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know a lot about art either. I'm just going to support her tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I prefer music. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to see your work one day. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go see them. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  She looks like she's trying to get attention. <EOS>
<BOS> Her boss's attention. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you ok? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you go to the hospital? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car involved? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Is he or she ok? <EOS>
<BOS> This could've been a serious accident. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is your car? Is it getting fixed? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Is your insurance going to pay for a new car? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. Are you going to buy the same type of car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you buying a new TV? <EOS>
<BOS> That's so nice of you. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you buy one for yourself? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. They're great. They're like mini computers. I love the touch screen feature. <EOS>
<BOS> Is that why you are helping him buy one? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I should get another one too. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I've been in meetings all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I have another meeting at 4 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> The managers are discussing annual employee reviews and raises. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  The end of the year is always the busiest. <EOS>
<BOS> There was a chemical explosion at my old office. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know yet.  <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  The building was so old.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  The police and fire department are still there. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean?  This place is awful. <EOS>
<BOS> There is a bug in my bed. <EOS>
<BOS> I miss that puppy. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I don't remember his name. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yeah.  It was a sad day when Buster died. <EOS>
<BOS> How old was Buster when he died? <EOS>
<BOS> His order was not delivered and he is very angry. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  He doesn't want to talk to me anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Why, Kate? Are you sick? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Can I help you with anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. How many days do you think you'll miss class? <EOS>
<BOS> Is the hospital close by? <EOS>
<BOS> I hope he recovers soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll take good notes in class and make copies for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me know if you need anything else. Call me later. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to get a glass of beer. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  Do you want a draught or a bottle? <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you too, Vincent.   <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! <EOS>
<BOS> You have a view of the mountains. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand the stress part. <EOS>
<BOS> What is wrong with it? <EOS>
<BOS> We can definitely help you with that problem.  Can you bring it to the store today? <EOS>
<BOS> Absolutely!  I will try to find out what the problem is. <EOS>
<BOS> We think supporting our customers after the purchase is also very important. <EOS>
<BOS> Pizza sounds good. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I don't want to go out to pick it up.   <EOS>
<BOS> No, I have to go to the mall. I have to get a birthday present for Phil. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. He seems to have everything. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He loves golf, but he has everything he needs for golf. <EOS>
<BOS> He has plenty of clothes and shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what I mean. He has everything! <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I'm just going to go to the mall and hope I find something. Would you like to come with me? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. We'll need a break from searching for his gift. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is he such a grump in the morning? <EOS>
<BOS> I have to work. <EOS>
<BOS> 7 pm. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What time does it start? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm the only one available tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> I might be really late. I have to go home first to shower and change my clothes. Then I have to drive all the way to the concert hall. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that might be a better idea. I'm sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds good. Have a great time! <EOS>
<BOS> Please, Mom. <EOS>
<BOS> This toy helicopter. <EOS>
<BOS> He'll like it too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He and I like the same things. <EOS>
<BOS> I can play with it at his house. If I like it, then can I get one, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Great! My birthday is next month. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Mom. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you know that? <EOS>
<BOS> Sharon told me too. <EOS>
<BOS> We are all stressed out and working every weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I quit. <EOS>
<BOS> Then ask your boss to hire one more person. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I see that you take quite a few business trips a month. <EOS>
<BOS> I noticed that you are not signed up for frequent flier miles. <EOS>
<BOS> Please sign up before your next trip.  You can earn miles and get a free trip anywhere in the country. <EOS>
<BOS> It's easy to sign up.  You can do it online. <EOS>
<BOS> When will it arrive? <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect.  It is a birthday gift for my mother. <EOS>
<BOS> In two weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Here is my cell phone number. <EOS>
<BOS> The customer wants a full refund on something she purchased over a year ago. <EOS>
<BOS> I explained that to her, but she is demanding a refund. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I told her she needs to contact the manufacturer. <EOS>
<BOS> She is refusing to call the manufacturer because she doesn't have a warranty. <EOS>
<BOS> When a company buys another company. <EOS>
<BOS> We can't compete with the bigger company. <EOS>
<BOS> At the end of this year. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Are you worried? <EOS>
<BOS> That sucks. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you help my son with his school project? <EOS>
<BOS> He needs to draw a picture of a big castle. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He didn't tell me until today. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you come for dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you! I cannot draw at all and I was so worried about this assignment. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What did she steal? <EOS>
<BOS> How much? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  Cheryl is the vice-president of the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Something for my new apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it's great. But my apartment is so empty. I need some furniture to make it feel cozy. <EOS>
<BOS> I already have a bed and a sofa that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a dining table and chairs. <EOS>
<BOS> Right now, I eat on the sofa. But I'd like to invite people over for dinner and be able to dine comfortably. <EOS>
<BOS> I have some money saved, but not a lot. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal. I can just paint them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I'm excited to see what I can find. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a little high. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll give you $22,000 for it. <EOS>
<BOS> How low can you go? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not much of a discount.  How about $25,000? <EOS>
<BOS> I can pay in cash. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not really hungry.  I'm just going to have a salad. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I'll order something to go too. <EOS>
<BOS> Spinach.  There are reports of e-coli found in some of our spinach.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It can be fatal. <EOS>
<BOS> We haven't received any reports of deaths yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Ted and I have never been there. <EOS>
<BOS> Ted doesn't like beaches.  He likes to sightsee. <EOS>
<BOS> I may have to talk him into it. <EOS>
<BOS> How much do you charge? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to visit my parents for a few days. <EOS>
<BOS> No. They live in New York. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It's beautiful. I take a lot of pictures since we don't get much snow here. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I miss seeing snow. <EOS>
<BOS> That's an idea. But I don't know how to ski? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we didn't do much skiing growing up. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ok. I'd rather just drink hot chocolate and snuggle in warm blankets by the fireplace. <EOS>
<BOS> It looks like you have. <EOS>
<BOS> My garden looks terrible. No matter how hard I try, everything dies. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I also water my flowers regularly and trim any dead leaves. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know what's wrong. <EOS>
<BOS> What is a green thumb? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. Then I definitely do not have a green thumb. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you teach me? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  When you drop Katie off, you have to walk her to her classroom. <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like you need to drop the kids off at school more often. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you spend your New Year's Eve? <EOS>
<BOS> I worked until 9 pm and met some friends afterwards. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I stayed up until midnight to wish everyone a 'Happy New Year.' Then I went home to sleep. I was so tired. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I'm going to my parents' house. I'm going to watch the Rose Bowl on TV with my dad. It's our annual tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> You've never heard of the Rose Bowl? It's a big American college football game. It's played every January 1. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you ever watched the Tournament of Roses parade? <EOS>
<BOS> It's a big parade that is shown before the football game. It's America's New Year celebration. <EOS>
<BOS> You should watch it. It's an annual American tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I better go now. Happy New Year, Sue! <EOS>
<BOS> Did you make any new friends? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he nice? What's his name? <EOS>
<BOS> You love soccer. You were on the soccer team at your old school. <EOS>
<BOS> I know you do. Do you want to invite Brian over to play one day? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to start riding the school bus too. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's plan for you to ride the bus tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you need to wake up at 7 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Was it better than the last concert that you went to? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I wasn't sick.  I'm sad I missed it. <EOS>
<BOS> I was just at the library. I had to check out some books. It was really crowded today. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck finding a spot. All the computers were taken when I was there. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to use my computer? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I stayed up all night to finish it. <EOS>
<BOS> Were you busy? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm heading home right now. Do you want to go with me? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. After you finish your report. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's call a plumber. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you ride this bus every day? <EOS>
<BOS> Not every day. Only a couple of times a week. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. Does the weather make a difference? <EOS>
<BOS> Because of bad traffic? <EOS>
<BOS> That makes sense. I must have picked the wrong day to ride the bus. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> You are totally right! I'm going to check the weather from now on. I'm going to take the bus when it rains. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! It was nice talking with you. <EOS>
<BOS> What do I need to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I have very important business papers in my suitcase. <EOS>
<BOS> Will you contact me as soon as you find it? <EOS>
<BOS> I am staying in a hotel downtown. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I made spaghetti sauce with them. I'm growing more vegetables this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Zucchinis and lettuce. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'll let you know when the zucchinis and lettuce are ready. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you always make me apple pies with apples from your apple tree. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a deal! <EOS>
<BOS> No. I like giving them to my family and friends. <EOS>
<BOS> I live alone, so I can't eat all of the vegetables by myself. <EOS>
<BOS> Around 3 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a science project due on Monday. <EOS>
<BOS> Jane asked if I could sleep over. <EOS>
<BOS> She is asking her mom right now. <EOS>
<BOS> How old are they now? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  They're growing up. <EOS>
<BOS> Financial trouble. <EOS>
<BOS> I overheard Lou talking about bankruptcy laws. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have any tips for me? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean by that? <EOS>
<BOS> That makes sense. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. <EOS>
<BOS> That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a girl? <EOS>
<BOS> What a beautiful name! <EOS>
<BOS> My daughter is also named after my grandmother. Her name is Marie. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Is this your sister's first child? <EOS>
<BOS> How special! <EOS>
<BOS> That's wonderful. It's nice to have a lot of help with your first child. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. See you in two weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm opening a restaurant soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Chinese cuisine. <EOS>
<BOS> It's been my dream to open a restaurant in America. <EOS>
<BOS> I finally saved up enough money to open my own restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know yet. It's a very old building and I need to make some repairs first. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I owned a restaurant in China many years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you and Carol like to come over and try some of my dishes tonight? I want to create a menu of my best dishes. <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect! You can tell me what you think of my food. <EOS>
<BOS> Today? It's going to rain all day. <EOS>
<BOS> They don't cancel games if it rains? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! But, I bet it's fun to watch. <EOS>
<BOS> How long has she been playing? <EOS>
<BOS> She's a smart girl! Did you play soccer, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you worry that she could get hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe we'll see her in the Olympics one day. <EOS>
<BOS> We've invited a couple of professional golfers.  We're going to do a celebrity golf tournament. <EOS>
<BOS> I just need to hear back from the golfers. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I'm in big trouble! <EOS>
<BOS> It's a great day for it. Nice and sunny. <EOS>
<BOS> I used to play in high school. I was on the school basketball team. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't today. I have to dentist appointment. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It was the only day available. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Sounds like fun. What time? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think your friends will be ok with a new guy joining? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Then I'll see you next Saturday. <EOS>
<BOS> How old is your daughter? <EOS>
<BOS> We have lots of cute bikes for girls. Does she like a particular color? <EOS>
<BOS> We have a few purple bikes. Let me show you. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to add a basket to the front of the bike? <EOS>
<BOS> $50. <EOS>
<BOS> Unfortunately, this is one of the least expensive bikes we have. <EOS>
<BOS> This bike has an adjustable height. So, it will grow a few inches as your child grows. <EOS>
<BOS> We have a 100% money-back guarantee. <EOS>
<BOS> You can return it for a full refund if you are not satisfied with the product. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I didn't think it was necessary, but now I think I should get one. <EOS>
<BOS> My car broke down in the middle of the road last night and I had to walk to the nearest pay phone to call a friend. It was scary walking alone at night. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a basic one. I don't need anything fancy. <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> No. Can you explain it to me? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't need those things. I don't even have an e-mail address. <EOS>
<BOS> No. <EOS>
<BOS> I write and mail letters. <EOS>
<BOS> But I think I will get a cell phone, just in case of an emergency. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? That's terrible! <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Is he in a lot of pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. <EOS>
<BOS> Because of the pain? <EOS>
<BOS> That must really hurt more than the arm. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he going to go to the game? <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully, his team will win! <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you too.  I'm the head of Marketing. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that's what I hear.  Let me know if you have any questions. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you join us this Saturday? <EOS>
<BOS> I heard that our client does not like to lose. <EOS>
<BOS> What should I do? <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you give them your business card? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh.  That's not very professional looking. <EOS>
<BOS> Try to stay positive.  Send them your resume.  See what happens. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> This job is so stressful, Karen! <EOS>
<BOS> I can't right now. I have a big presentation on Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> I have another project after this one. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But I have a lot of responsibilities. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. I need to talk to the boss and tell him that I need a vacation. Do you think he will understand? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will talk to him today. Thanks for your advice. <EOS>
<BOS> A nice, warm beach. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh really? How exciting. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd love to see her perform some day. Let me know when she will be on stage again. <EOS>
<BOS> Is she nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> Is this part of her school assignment? <EOS>
<BOS> She won the lead part? <EOS>
<BOS> How does she feel about that? <EOS>
<BOS> But she is not going to be graded on it. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. Well, have a lovely time tonight! <EOS>
<BOS> I like the beach so we can swim. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea.  Two family vacations in one year.   <EOS>
<BOS> Sylvia was against everything. <EOS>
<BOS> How can the boss handle her negative personality? <EOS>
<BOS> How can Sylvia have any friends?  She is so pessimistic about everything. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we talk to Jim? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  She's very nice. <EOS>
<BOS> She asked us a lot of questions about employee happiness and concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> What's the schedule? <EOS>
<BOS> You're having a good attitude about it. <EOS>
<BOS> You mean just let him talk? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good tip. <EOS>
<BOS> Yummy! What are we eating? <EOS>
<BOS> Yay! That is my favorite food. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, can I invite someone? <EOS>
<BOS> Our new neighbor down the street. He is new to this country. He's never celebrated 4th of July before. <EOS>
<BOS> Michael. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. He said he learned about it in school in his native country. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I forgot to ask him. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is Dad? <EOS>
<BOS> We have to construct a building using any materials around the house. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to build a skyscraper. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. I was thinking about using cardboard boxes. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are they? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Where should we put them? <EOS>
<BOS> Mom isn't going to be happy with all the mess. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What should I do first? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good plan. Thanks for your help, Dad. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could go, but I have to babysit my younger sister. <EOS>
<BOS> Now I really wish I could go. That sounds like so much fun. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Our regular babysitter got sick, so they asked me. <EOS>
<BOS> 9 o'clock pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Will you still be awake? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! Please save me some pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> Bill, would you like to come to a backyard barbeque? <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow at 5 o'clock PM. <EOS>
<BOS> I invited a few other neighbors. <EOS>
<BOS> I got a new outdoor grill and I want to test it out. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to bring some beverages? <EOS>
<BOS> Great! I'm going to grill some hamburgers and hot dogs. <EOS>
<BOS> Our neighbor, Peter, is going to bring some apple pies. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. I hope my grill works well. <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. I like pizza too. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think so.  We give all employees many chances. <EOS>
<BOS> We will give him one more chance to improve. <EOS>
<BOS> Then we will have to let him go. <EOS>
<BOS> I just need an annual checkup. <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect.  Do I need to bring anything with me? <EOS>
<BOS> Then, how do you know what's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you want to know as soon as something happens? <EOS>
<BOS> Why is it scary? <EOS>
<BOS> It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go to the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen. <EOS>
<BOS> It's in the bathroom cabinet. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you remember the last time we went to the beach? <EOS>
<BOS> Because you're always watching TV. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a deal! <EOS>
<BOS> It will not turn on. <EOS>
<BOS> How much is the repair cost? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a charge to see what repairs are needed?   <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  How long will it take? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of ad is it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's why the callers keep asking me if we have any specials this week. <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm afraid to graduate. <EOS>
<BOS> College was easy for me. Now we have to go out and find a real job. <EOS>
<BOS> Aren't you scared at all? <EOS>
<BOS> I feel so immature. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. Studying and taking tests were easy. Now we have to work for the rest of our lives. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for your encouragement. I feel silly. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> I came up with that idea during our meeting yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> You are a liar!  You said it was a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> I am going to tell her that you stole my idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do.  I recorded our meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> Our clients have a hard time finding the exit and our offices. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we redesign it? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think we have the budget for it. <EOS>
<BOS> But we should do something soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you had dinner plans with your wife. <EOS>
<BOS> Isn't it your anniversary today? <EOS>
<BOS> You should tell your boss you have anniversary plans tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible.  You should find another job. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think he was rude.   <EOS>
<BOS> Tom asked John a question. <EOS>
<BOS> John was just telling the truth. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you shouldn't ask questions. <EOS>
<BOS> What about next Saturday? <EOS>
<BOS> You have a busy schedule. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no. Let me help you find him. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you called the local dog shelters? <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have any identification on him? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. Should we make some flyers to post around the neighborhood? <EOS>
<BOS> How old is Rusty? <EOS>
<BOS> I know what he looks like. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. He's part of your family. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Phil! There he is! <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> What if you have a lot of work to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I was like you. <EOS>
<BOS> My dog is sick. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to take him to the vet. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you for understanding. <EOS>
<BOS> We're all getting raises and bonuses this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too.  We haven't had raises in four years.   <EOS>
<BOS> That's right!   <EOS>
<BOS> I agree.  We work really hard. <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to stay in a small cottage. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to take pictures of the flowers, trees, and meadows.   <EOS>
<BOS> A meadow is an open area of grass. <EOS>
<BOS> I got a new camera for my birthday.   <EOS>
<BOS> What is President's Day? <EOS>
<BOS> All of the former presidents? <EOS>
<BOS> Were they both born in February? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it celebrated on the same day each year? <EOS>
<BOS> Are businesses closed, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Do all schools close? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks for the information. How do you know so much about President's Day? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you met Larry?  He's our technical support guy. <EOS>
<BOS> Make sure you're nice to him. If he doesn't like you, he won't help you right away. <EOS>
<BOS> Our office goes out to lunch together every Tuesday.  You should join us. <EOS>
<BOS> Good.  Well, let me know if you have any questions or concerns. <EOS>
<BOS> I do not get off work until 5 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> That's perfect. <EOS>
<BOS> They are on sale at the market. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Who? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. But Linda is a vegetarian. <EOS>
<BOS> A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat. <EOS>
<BOS> How about Susie? <EOS>
<BOS> I will go to the market and buy four steaks. What else should we eat? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will go to the market now. Can you call Sandy and Susie? <EOS>
<BOS> It's raining. What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll be back soon. I hope the weather gets better. <EOS>
<BOS> I haven't found one yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Who wrote that? <EOS>
<BOS> I've never heard of him. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary.  Don't you have family there? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you talked to her? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We have to give our dog away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But we just discovered that our son is allergic to dogs. <EOS>
<BOS> When Steven was a baby, we didn't know he was allergic. But now he's crawling around and playing with Buster. His symptoms get really bad. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. We got Buster before our son was born. Charlie is so sad. <EOS>
<BOS> I asked my sister and Charlie asked his brothers. But no one is able to take a dog right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? You would do that? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you need to talk to Stan first! <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! <EOS>
<BOS> You're the best neighbor anyone could have. <EOS>
<BOS> On a business trip to New York.  Can you keep an eye on my house? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm a little nervous to leave. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Do you have one? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe I should get one too. <EOS>
<BOS> I need help moving stuff to my new apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> You didn't sound busy. <EOS>
<BOS> If you're lying, you're a terrible person. <EOS>
<BOS> Why did you lie? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? It was very hard for me. I'm having a hard time in this class. <EOS>
<BOS> A tutor? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a great idea. Could I have your tutor's phone number? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. That's too bad. I don't know where to look. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. That would be great. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That would be awesome. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! I would love to. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I received a new business opportunity. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll tell you all about it over lunch. <EOS>
<BOS> That works for me.  Should we meet in my office? <EOS>
<BOS> Even better!  Let's meet at the restaurant across the street. <EOS>
<BOS> Someone escaped from prison. <EOS>
<BOS> The police say he is armed and dangerous. <EOS>
<BOS> We're having dinner with friends. Why? What's going on? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That's so nice of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course we will. I'll reschedule the dinner party. <EOS>
<BOS> I won't. Is Dad sad about retiring? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I remember all of those long hours he worked. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you and Dad going to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good! It's a great place to relax. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That would be awesome! <EOS>
<BOS> Mom, that sounds awesome. But I'll miss you both. <EOS>
<BOS> A 20 pound salmon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, just a couple of small trout. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't give up. You might catch something soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Fish? <EOS>
<BOS> That's silly. Just wait. <EOS>
<BOS> At least it didn't rain today. We had clear skies all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Wait, John! <EOS>
<BOS> Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it! <EOS>
<BOS> I told you to be patient and you would catch something. <EOS>
<BOS> Several years old. It was a high school graduation gift from my parents. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow. Can you go around 6 o'clock tomorrow evening? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll do some research on computers tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! <EOS>
<BOS> I have a bad memory. <EOS>
<BOS> $20. <EOS>
<BOS> Did I borrow $20 before? <EOS>
<BOS> I told you that I have a bad memory. <EOS>
<BOS> But your coffee is not very healthy. <EOS>
<BOS> You put lots of cream and sugar in your coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> You should drink it black like me. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think your coffee will prevent cancer. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  This is my first time. <EOS>
<BOS> Any other advice? <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you too.  Please let me know if you have any questions. <EOS>
<BOS> Here is my business card.  You can contact me by email, office phone, or cell phone. <EOS>
<BOS> To 5th Avenue and Main Street. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! It's so hard to catch a cab at this time. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm meeting some friends at a restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Have you been there? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh good. It's my first time trying Thai food. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to hear. I'm a little picky about food. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awesome! <EOS>
<BOS> You're funny! <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I do.  He's smart. <EOS>
<BOS> He can handle it. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a question about Thanksgiving. What does that day mean? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the date? <EOS>
<BOS> That's interesting. Why do Americans celebrate this day? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. Is there anything special Americans do on that day like fireworks on the 4th of July? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That sounds like a feast. Can your family eat all of that? <EOS>
<BOS> It's like a family reunion. <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds like a nice tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> I like this tradition. Maybe I will roast a turkey this year. Will you teach me? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't drink at all.  I'm afraid he's going to think I'm boring. <EOS>
<BOS> People are not going to apply for loans right now. <EOS>
<BOS> People will wait to see if the rates go down. <EOS>
<BOS> How's it going? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of problems. <EOS>
<BOS> That can be very annoying. <EOS>
<BOS> When is the deadline? <EOS>
<BOS> Where's the rest of your group? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. What are you going to do after your deadline is over? <EOS>
<BOS> Good for you! <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  You can wear jeans and t-shirts or shorts? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great!  We had to wear suits to work every day at my old job. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Our president was very conservative. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  Wearing pantyhose every day is very uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> I have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I have to go back in six months. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! What are you making? <EOS>
<BOS> My mother-in-law is a vegetarian. I can ask her for some recipes. <EOS>
<BOS> You shouldn't worry. You're a great cook. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. I cooked for my boss once. It was a disaster. I burned the roast beef. <EOS>
<BOS> I was too busy talking and forgot to take it out of the oven. We all laughed, but I was so embarrassed. <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Your lasagna is delicious. My mother-in-law makes great vegetarian lasagna. I'll call her right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go together? <EOS>
<BOS> I just bought a new washer and dryer set. I love it! <EOS>
<BOS> You should really look into upgrading your set. It can save you money? <EOS>
<BOS> The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy. <EOS>
<BOS> I can show you what I bought. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set. I paid full price for mine. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I was foolish. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go check out the new store. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love an SUV.  They have more room. <EOS>
<BOS> A sports car can't seat a lot of people. <EOS>
<BOS> Our kids and their friends. <EOS>
<BOS> We're leaving at 5 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> I should do that too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  We finally finished a big project. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me know if you can join us later. <EOS>
<BOS> Two reports? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a tight deadline. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good.   <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> I think I know what it is? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Is it a fishing pole? <EOS>
<BOS> It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't wait! <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, dad. <EOS>
<BOS> What's bait? <EOS>
<BOS> Like worms? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to bring them a plate of cookies and ask them to turn the music down. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm trying to be a nice neighbor. <EOS>
<BOS> The food isn't very good and the prices are too high. <EOS>
<BOS> I would rather have good food and low prices.   <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What was wrong with the second room? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice! So, why was it so awful? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you ask for another room? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry you had a terrible time. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to go back there? <EOS>
<BOS> What? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you get those? The concert has been sold out for months. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I need to ask my mom, but I'm sure I can go. <EOS>
<BOS> What time does the concert start? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are we leaving so early? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll let my mom know. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too! Thank you so much for inviting me. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Linda. Why are you calling so early in the morning? Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great news! When did you find out? <EOS>
<BOS> You can call me anytime, Linda. How does Dan feel? <EOS>
<BOS> Already? That is funny! When is the baby due? <EOS>
<BOS> How are you feeling? Do you feel sick at all? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you able to eat anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me come over and make you something to eat. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't be silly. I'll buy you breakfast. I'll be there in 30 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> How many layovers?  <EOS>
<BOS> That's fine.  Can you book that flight please? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I will park my car at the airport. <EOS>
<BOS> That's expensive.  We're buying a large amount of office supplies.  Can you give us a discount on the delivery fee? <EOS>
<BOS> If we are happy with the service, we will continue buying all of our supplies from your company. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to talk to him about my start time.  I need to start an hour later. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. What is she going to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't think they had any children. <EOS>
<BOS> I think she had one sister, but she passed away several years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Isn't that sad? <EOS>
<BOS> She is always so nice to everyone. I think we should all get together and do something nice for her. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's take turns helping her around the house? <EOS>
<BOS> I love this. Let's talk to the other neighbors soon. <EOS>
<BOS> How old is Joseph now? <EOS>
<BOS> He's almost a teenager. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you doing anything special? <EOS>
<BOS> What a fun day for him. <EOS>
<BOS> Then he's going to eat again after the party? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you make a birthday cake? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't forget the candles. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a brand new pack. There are 12 candles in the box. You can have them. <EOS>
<BOS> The company is changing the dress code. <EOS>
<BOS> Every Friday is going to be casual day. <EOS>
<BOS> We can come to work in casual clothes like jeans, but no inappropriate clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> This is only on Fridays though. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?   <EOS>
<BOS> That's strange. <EOS>
<BOS> I saw her get into a taxi this morning.  She was carrying luggage. <EOS>
<BOS> It looked like it.  Doesn't she always call in sick on Fridays? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I got done an hour ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> What if our friends are not done with exams. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know how to dance. <EOS>
<BOS> I look silly when I dance. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's do something else. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go see a play? <EOS>
<BOS> I think we have different ideas of fun. <EOS>
<BOS> I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never read it. <EOS>
<BOS> Could you lend it to me? <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean? <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean for us? <EOS>
<BOS> It's beautiful there! The beaches are sandy and the weather is nice. <EOS>
<BOS> That must be fun too. <EOS>
<BOS> Two weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to find a part-time job. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I need to make some money for college. <EOS>
<BOS> How long are you going to be in Germany? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a long time. That's almost the whole summer vacation. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. Family is important. <EOS>
<BOS> No. What do they say? <EOS>
<BOS> That's silly. That's an old tale. <EOS>
<BOS> No, absolutely not. <EOS>
<BOS> What are werewolves? <EOS>
<BOS> Now you are being ridiculous. I'm going to look for the brightest star. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to wish that we stop this conversation. <EOS>
<BOS> You've been watching too many horror movies. <EOS>
<BOS> You should go home on time. <EOS>
<BOS> You need a better work-life balance. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Let's find a seat.   <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like it at all. <EOS>
<BOS> It's been raining all week? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I just got back from Hawaii last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I do! <EOS>
<BOS> He is so rude.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but he makes me so angry. <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there an extra charge for this service? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like fun. <EOS>
<BOS> May I? I would love to join. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me ask my parents. What should I bring? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How about food? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll be back as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> I will. If I can't go, I will call you. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. I have no plans today. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so! <EOS>
<BOS> But, I'm hungry. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Can I have it after dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> Under his bed? <EOS>
<BOS> How did you find them? <EOS>
<BOS> How late are they? <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you receive notices before? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't he return them? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he in trouble? <EOS>
<BOS> That's five weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm meeting Olivia there. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a couple of hours. <EOS>
<BOS> What is in the package? <EOS>
<BOS> Are there any breakables? Is it fragile? <EOS>
<BOS> Please fill out this form. Print clearly. Sometimes, it is hard to read. <EOS>
<BOS> It depends on your shipping choice. <EOS>
<BOS> It will be there in one week. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the cost. How would you like to pay? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Is there anything else I can help you with today? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you. Have a nice day. <EOS>
<BOS> Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! <EOS>
<BOS> How scary for him. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible! <EOS>
<BOS> You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think he will go to jail? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I help you with anything? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. How long did you work there? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't say that. Companies usually downsize because they are losing money. <EOS>
<BOS> Does your wife know? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. What kind of work did you do? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? My son is a website developer. Do you know anything about web design? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me give him a call. Maybe he can help you find a job. <EOS>
<BOS> My apartment elevator has been out of order for two weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> It's been hard bringing groceries home. <EOS>
<BOS> The manager doesn't know.  <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't care.  He lives on the first floor. <EOS>
<BOS> The park? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great tradition. Does it get crowded there? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there parking available? <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you get there? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you take your dog? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. Poor dog. <EOS>
<BOS> Your parents don't like fireworks? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I understand. That's why I watch the fireworks on TV. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry, but I have to leave early today. <EOS>
<BOS> I have tickets to the baseball game. <EOS>
<BOS> Our seats are right behind home plate. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I wasn't. <EOS>
<BOS> I did?  I'm sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go to Starbucks. <EOS>
<BOS> Why not?  They have delicious coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> Fine.  But next time we are going to Starbucks. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Congratulations! I knew you would get it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! When is your first day of work? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do for the next few days? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you told anyone else yet? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, we should celebrate. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll buy you dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But you can buy me dinner after you get your first paycheck. <EOS>
<BOS> Our company lets their employees use the free airline ticket for personal use. <EOS>
<BOS> You should probably use it during your next vacation. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> I need my suitcase.  I have a business meeting today and my suit is in it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It just can't compete with new technology. <EOS>
<BOS> Fifteen years. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm going to miss that place. <EOS>
<BOS> Look for another job. <EOS>
<BOS> If I don't do it, it'll never get done. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know why the boss doesn't fire him. <EOS>
<BOS> What a loser! <EOS>
<BOS> I don't care anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> About what? <EOS>
<BOS> Finally!  <EOS>
<BOS> I wonder what Karen is saying. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you know? <EOS>
<BOS> I was thinking about a dog. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm allergic to cats. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Is everyone ok? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, you are very lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe it. Will insurance cover the repair costs? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? DO you have a place to stay while your house gets fixed? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good! <EOS>
<BOS> You're a strong man if you can joke about it. <EOS>
<BOS> I would be crying right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  She is always organizing her office. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  One time she got mad at me because I accidentally moved her plant. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not funny.  She got very mad at me. <EOS>
<BOS> I will never touch anything in her office again. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you fail it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe the teacher will let you take the test again. <EOS>
<BOS> I did poorly on my English test last week and my teacher let me take it again. <EOS>
<BOS> You better study next time. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do now? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea! I'll meet you at the library later. Good luck with our science teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> That you're leaving the company. <EOS>
<BOS> Everyone is talking about it. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job. <EOS>
<BOS> Is he close to us? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I would have to buy a used car. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking. <EOS>
<BOS> Where did you see it last? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'm almost done packing too. I just need to load the tents into the car. <EOS>
<BOS> Good. What is your mom doing? <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully, we will catch some fish to eat too. <EOS>
<BOS> I forgot it. Thanks for reminding me. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I want to try a new place. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. But be careful not to lose it. <EOS>
<BOS> Make sure to take pictures of our fish. <EOS>
<BOS> I love spending time as a family. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to smell the flowers and read books under a tree. <EOS>
<BOS> It's very relaxing. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Let me know when you're done. <EOS>
<BOS> We seem to have many angry clients these days.  <EOS>
<BOS> I'm buying my first car. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been saving money for the last couple of years and now I have enough to put a down payment on a car. <EOS>
<BOS> A new one. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I have a picture of it on my phone. <EOS>
<BOS> But I want it in blue. Blue is my favorite color. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. That's my problem. I'm not good at negotiating. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be awesome! <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go! <EOS>
<BOS> Service is down.  It's not working in many areas right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Can you grab some of these calls? <EOS>
<BOS> You pick. <EOS>
<BOS> I have proof you did it. <EOS>
<BOS> I secretly video recorded my yard. <EOS>
<BOS> I had a very difficult customer. <EOS>
<BOS> She was screaming at me and not listening to anything I was saying. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great graduation gift! He's a lucky boy. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you sending him? <EOS>
<BOS> Does he know anyone there? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. It will be more fun if he knows someone there. <EOS>
<BOS> Does he know about this trip? <EOS>
<BOS> I promise I won't. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm planning a trip to Hawaii. Bill and I go every summer. <EOS>
<BOS> The customer says he wants to return his refrigerator. <EOS>
<BOS> He says it doesn't work anymore.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  He won't listen to me.   <EOS>
<BOS> He wants a free replacement right now.   <EOS>
<BOS> Can you please talk to him? <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Sarah. I'm fine. I'm working on my new computer. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. I signed up for a computer class for senior citizens. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, yes. It's been really fun. I'm just learning the basics right now. <EOS>
<BOS> We have homework once a week. This week we have to type a short essay about ourselves. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. That's what we're learning. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I'm not confident about editing yet. Can you help me? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Do you want me to make you dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I'll make us dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> No, she's not.   <EOS>
<BOS> She put a fake recipe book in the safe.  No one knows where the real one is. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  You'll do a great job at your new department. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard she is nice but also serious about getting the job done. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you shouldn't have any problems. <EOS>
<BOS> Be a team player.  Get along with your new co-workers. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea.  I'll outline what needs to be done. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!   <EOS>
<BOS> Will this be your first visit? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything wrong with your teeth? <EOS>
<BOS> We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am. <EOS>
<BOS> We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have dental insurance? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome. We'll see you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too. But my car is at the repair shop. <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing serious. Just an oil change. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Which one are you going to? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me check my purse and see if I have any coupons too. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I use their coupons all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons? <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you leaving? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll be right back. <EOS>
<BOS> It does not fit. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I would just like a refund please. <EOS>
<BOS> She's the problem. <EOS>
<BOS> She speaks too fast.  I don't understand what she's saying. <EOS>
<BOS> It's hard to say.  I told all of them to send me their resumes. <EOS>
<BOS> I've already received more than half. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I remember when I was young and looking for jobs.   <EOS>
<BOS> I fully understand what they're going through. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Is that going to take a long time? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't you clean it before? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but I try to finish them as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. I got a new video game I wanted to show you. <EOS>
<BOS> No way! I'm going to enjoy my Friday afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> Finish your chores earlier next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I think my son will be more interested in those things too. <EOS>
<BOS> My boss gave me his season tickets for this game. We're sitting right behind home plate. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. He has three children. They are all grown up now, but he still takes them to games. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what I'm hoping for. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. My son wants to take it just in case he catches a foul ball. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, I want to take our mitts so we can get them signed by one of the players. <EOS>
<BOS> He would be so thrilled. <EOS>
<BOS> Could you tell him my flight has been delayed? <EOS>
<BOS> My flight isn't leaving for another hour.   <EOS>
<BOS> Tell him I need to reschedule the meeting. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll call him on his cell phone. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yeah. It's our annual family reunion. <EOS>
<BOS> I remember it was at Uncle Walter's house last year. That was fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Could you please go to the store and buy some ice? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. It's going to be hot today. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure it will be fine. What are you making? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know what other people are bringing. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like a feast. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. She is my favorite aunt. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't wait to see all of my cousins. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe a dog or a cat. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  But I'm lonely. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to ask for a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to negotiate for a bigger raise. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn't like my taste in jewelry. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn't like my taste in clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I want it to be a surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> That's why I need your help. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> We do that often. I want to do something more fun. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out. <EOS>
<BOS> It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Steve! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure! This is very generous of you. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad we're neighbors. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I broke my arm. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  It hurts if I try to move it. <EOS>
<BOS> The emergency room is too expensive.  I do not have medical insurance. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, my friend is going to drive. <EOS>
<BOS> I was wondering if you were still interested in looking at my resume. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, you did.  I will send it to you today. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> That should be interesting. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm scheduled to go next month. <EOS>
<BOS> Give me some tips after you return from your trip. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Pamela. Where have you been? You haven't been in school for a week. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you feeling better now? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good! We all missed you. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We had homework every night and we have a test next Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> Talk to the teacher. She will understand. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to borrow my notes from class? I can make copies of them and bring them to you. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. But don't try to finish everything over the weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll see you around 4 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Great. Thanks. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I need to clean out my attic today. It's getting full up there. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I don't even remember what's in there anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what my wife said. <EOS>
<BOS> They must be talking to each other. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I'm going to have a garage sale next weekend. What did you do with all of your stuff? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Maybe I'll donate the things I don't need. <EOS>
<BOS> That's just going to be another chore to do. I'd rather go golfing. <EOS>
<BOS> She can't decide between a bear and a lion. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not this year. It's too much work. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> That's smart. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. That's why I made Sally's costume last year. <EOS>
<BOS> A butterfly. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. This year, she wants to be an animal. <EOS>
<BOS> True! I better check out the costume store soon before everything is sold out. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year. <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you go in the morning? <EOS>
<BOS> 5 am? That's too early. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm asleep at 5 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I hate running. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have the strength to lift weights. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too much jumping around? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to take a long lunch. <EOS>
<BOS> How about 6 PM? <EOS>
<BOS> I can pick you up at your apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  What kind of food do you like? <EOS>
<BOS> There's a great Italian place downtown. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  He's not there. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right.  He never does any work. <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. How? <EOS>
<BOS> Ouch! <EOS>
<BOS> How did you get back to your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Were you alone? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't you call someone? <EOS>
<BOS> How long do you have to wear your cast? <EOS>
<BOS> Six weeks? Are you going to miss the marathon next month? <EOS>
<BOS> No, thanks. Do you know what I hate more than hiking? <EOS>
<BOS> Should we take the kids camping. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know what the weather forecast for this weekend? <EOS>
<BOS> I think it is supposed to be sunny and clear. <EOS>
<BOS> We can go fishing too. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's not tell them yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. How about going to the beach? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me try to make a reservation for camping first. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I don't have enough money for bills and rent.   <EOS>
<BOS> I need those things. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> Have any fun plans this weekend? <EOS>
<BOS> Lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going out on a boat? <EOS>
<BOS> My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I'm going to head home now. I'm tired. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  We drink so much coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll make a fresh pot. <EOS>
<BOS> My friend's company has paid vacation time plus bonuses, retirement plans, gym memberships, maternity leave, and much more. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.   <EOS>
<BOS> I've tried.  I applied three times and had no luck. <EOS>
<BOS> I have a huge favor to ask. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you fill in for me tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> My mom is having surgery.  I want to take her to the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  I'll fill in for you next time. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to plan for my future. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know anything about stocks. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you like it? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you do there? <EOS>
<BOS> Was it fun? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to find a job. I was thinking about applying at a fast food restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a fast learner and I can move pretty quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have any customer service experience. <EOS>
<BOS> I can do that. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you get to eat a lot of the food? <EOS>
<BOS> I love fast food. I may eat it every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't see any in the refrigerator. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess so.   <EOS>
<BOS> I can't find the eggs either. <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you always eat so much? <EOS>
<BOS> You need to control yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> She made pumpkin pie, your favorite dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> Really?  That's the first time I have ever heard you say that. <EOS>
<BOS> How is that going? <EOS>
<BOS> How many kids do you want to invite? <EOS>
<BOS> No girls? <EOS>
<BOS> How about an outdoor party? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. That's not fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Kids like pizza. How about taking them to a movie theater, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. How about renting a movie and watching it at home after the pizza place? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a great party. <EOS>
<BOS> What is that? <EOS>
<BOS> So, it's like a museum for butterflies? <EOS>
<BOS> They're alive? <EOS>
<BOS> That's so fun! <EOS>
<BOS> Your grandkids are going to enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> If I were a child, I would enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. How old are your grandchildren? <EOS>
<BOS> I think they're both at a good age to enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> I think they will. Don't worry about it so much. Just go and have a good time. <EOS>
<BOS> Have fun! <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  Who was the last person working on it? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you do to it? <EOS>
<BOS> I knew this would happen. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  You always screw up the projects. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> What are the choices? <EOS>
<BOS> What sounds good to you? <EOS>
<BOS> How about Chinese food?  We can eat the leftovers tomorrow night. <EOS>
<BOS> I have killed every plant I have ever owned. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I water them and make sure they get enough sun, but they still die. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I don't buy plants anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you teach me how to care for plants? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! Can we shop for the plants together? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean by low maintenance? <EOS>
<BOS> That will be perfect for me. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do about all of your plants while you're on vacation? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> I agree.  Not too many people know about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't tell anyone.  This place will get crowded.  I hate crowded places. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll introduce you when she gets home. <EOS>
<BOS> She's really nice.  She's our age too. <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, let's invite a few couples. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Everyone was bitten by mosquitoes. <EOS>
<BOS> We used so much anti-itch cream. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's get those. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think our friends will come back to our party? <EOS>
<BOS> Mosquitoes are such pests. And, they carry diseases too. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't let the mosquitoes win. <EOS>
<BOS> We had a misunderstanding and she is not talking to me. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I said something silly and hurt her feelings. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not important. I don't want to discuss it. I just want to apologize to her. <EOS>
<BOS> I've already checked both places. <EOS>
<BOS> Her roommate said she wasn't home. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, several times. <EOS>
<BOS> She was! She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant. <EOS>
<BOS> I told her to exercise. <EOS>
<BOS> I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Sam, an old friend from college.   <EOS>
<BOS> At college graduation! <EOS>
<BOS> We had a lot of catching up to do. <EOS>
<BOS> How exciting! I wish I could go watch it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I won the school spelling bee when I was in high school. <EOS>
<BOS> I was undefeated until I graduated from high school. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that's part of the reason. I like words. I like reading and writing. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to. What time does it start? <EOS>
<BOS> "Ok. I'll be ready at 6 <EOS>
<BOS> Just stay focused and concentrate on each word. <EOS>
<BOS> Where? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't open the door for anyone. <EOS>
<BOS> If he starts barking, I'm grabbing my gun. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm always careful and prepared. <EOS>
<BOS> My boss and her husband can't go, so she gave them to me. <EOS>
<BOS> Third row! <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  My boss is really sad she can't go. <EOS>
<BOS> She isn't feeling well. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> But haven't you been practicing every day for this? <EOS>
<BOS> I've heard you play. You're terrific. <EOS>
<BOS> I was very nervous at my first piano recital too. It's normal to feel this way. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but I got out there and I played the best I could. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. Everyone clapped and then we had ice cream afterwards. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. <EOS>
<BOS> Susie, I don't want you to do something you don't want to. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Stan and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year. <EOS>
<BOS> She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish we could. <EOS>
<BOS> It's Friday night. <EOS>
<BOS> We just got done with a big project.  You should have some fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  You're going to miss a great time.   <EOS>
<BOS> What are you doing? <EOS>
<BOS> She is faking it. <EOS>
<BOS> She knew about the surprise party. <EOS>
<BOS> Betty accidentally told her about it. <EOS>
<BOS> She's a great actress. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to give a presentation in English tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I need help with grammar. <EOS>
<BOS> Could you listen to my presentation and correct my English? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks!  I'm so nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> We'd like to do basketball shoes too. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what we're hoping.  We need a new marketing strategy. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I was hoping you could help us with some advertising ideas. <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  I will email my team and get back to you as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> I order a black jacket, but I received a white one. <EOS>
<BOS> How do I return the wrong one? <EOS>
<BOS> Uncomfortable.  I've never traveled with my boss before. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  They are next to each other. <EOS>
<BOS> We have to sit on the plane together and eat meals together. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm just afraid I'm going to make a bad impression. <EOS>
<BOS> What time does the library open? <EOS>
<BOS> It's 5 pm right now. You've been here for six hours. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you taken a break. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to stay here? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, don't forget to eat dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'm done and I'm hungry. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to join me for dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to come back to the library after dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> The merchandise is so ugly and everything is very overpriced. <EOS>
<BOS> I wouldn't buy anything here.  This place is extremely overrated.   <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of magazine? <EOS>
<BOS> The magazine editor has bad taste. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are the classes? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you like it? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of dance are you learning? <EOS>
<BOS> Which one is your favorite? <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like a lot of fun. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm too old to take dance lessons. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Free? When are your lessons? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. I'll go next Monday. But don't laugh at me. I'm a terrible dancer. <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you study and take notes? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't you ask her to speak slowly? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll help you study.  I have a lot of notes. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you want to eat? <EOS>
<BOS> We always have pizza. Let's try something different. <EOS>
<BOS> How about sushi? <EOS>
<BOS> All sushi isn't raw. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Then what should we eat? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. But I think I want Chinese food instead. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, we agree on something. Let's go out to a Chinese restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> We never agree on anything. <EOS>
<BOS> He was arrested for murder. <EOS>
<BOS> His business partner. <EOS>
<BOS> These people are your friends.  They're not reporters. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not real news. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! I can help you with that. What is your name? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, Mr. Taylor. My name is Simon. What kind of phone would you like? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want a smart phone? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We have many phones to choose from. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We can find you something for sure. <EOS>
<BOS> What about this phone? It has many good features and it is on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> How about this one? It is the same price as the other one. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. If it stops working within one year, we will replace it for free. <EOS>
<BOS> Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with? <EOS>
<BOS> Again?  He's late for work almost every day. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it his brakes again? <EOS>
<BOS> How old is your son? <EOS>
<BOS> Does he like it? <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds exciting. I used to play baseball in college. <EOS>
<BOS> Pitcher. But I had to quit because of a shoulder injury. <EOS>
<BOS> Not anymore. I'm too old to play now. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I'm always free in the afternoon. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be fun. What time is the game? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Can I bring my wife? <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> They already did. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. We went to the doctor's office last week. They both got them. <EOS>
<BOS> I got one too. So did Jeff. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that could be true. But we don't want to risk it this year. <EOS>
<BOS> Both of my kids got really sick last year. I just want to give them extra protection just in case. <EOS>
<BOS> Even Bill? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, at least the three of you will be protected. <EOS>
<BOS> I will be working until 5 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I would love to. What time is the party? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will be a little late. I'll try to be there as soon as possible. <EOS>
<BOS> What can I bring? <EOS>
<BOS> I'd like to get her a gift. What does she like? <EOS>
<BOS> I really want to. Does she like music? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of music does she like? Pop, jazz, hip hop, classical? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I have an idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Employees still deserve raises.  We work hard. <EOS>
<BOS> I have an important report due tomorrow.   <EOS>
<BOS> No and I'm starting to feel sick. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have time to rest. <EOS>
<BOS> Your mom and I want you to start doing some chores. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course you will. First, let's start with cleaning up the playroom when it gets messy. <EOS>
<BOS> How about setting and clearing the dinner table. <EOS>
<BOS> And, loading and unloading the dishwasher. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I want you to share these chores with your sister. You can both decide which ones you want to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Why isn't this fair? <EOS>
<BOS> No, she won't. <EOS>
<BOS> We haven't told you how much you're getting yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  They are very uncomfortable. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you saying I can't return them? <EOS>
<BOS> Where is the manager?  I demand a refund now! <EOS>
<BOS> Maria.  She's from Spain. <EOS>
<BOS> She's a foreign exchange student. <EOS>
<BOS> She's really nice.  She has taught me some Spanish words. <EOS>
<BOS> You should try speaking Spanish to her. <EOS>
<BOS> Your grandparents are coming. <EOS>
<BOS> Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and hash browns. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope so. Your grandfather has a big appetite. I hope there's enough food. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to make sure there is enough food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great. Do you know where the juicer is? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm all out of eggs. Tell your Dad to go to the store and buy some eggs. I'll start on the bacon and hash browns. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you do in Math? <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't do too well. I failed the class. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I failed the final exam. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to take the class again during the summer or I can't graduate. <EOS>
<BOS> I was supposed to go on a vacation with my older brother.  We were going to go to Europe, but now I won't be able to. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. That would be nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it starts at the end of June. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I won't have much time to enjoy my summer, but I need to graduate. <EOS>
<BOS> That should be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Does he have a train set? <EOS>
<BOS> Then he's going to love this ride. <EOS>
<BOS> I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Make sure to take a picture of it. <EOS>
<BOS> Have a great train ride! <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a special occasion? <EOS>
<BOS> Does Mom know? <EOS>
<BOS> Where is Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so curious. Can you please tell me? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Can I help you with anything? <EOS>
<BOS> I know what we're doing! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. We're going to the lake! <EOS>
<BOS> You asked me to pack a swimsuit and a life jacket. Also, you are pulling out the canoe from the garage. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Why did you argue on your anniversary? <EOS>
<BOS> What was it? <EOS>
<BOS> A vacuum cleaner? That's not a very romantic gift. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I can understand her. <EOS>
<BOS> What did she get you? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a very nice gift. <EOS>
<BOS> That's really the same thing, John. <EOS>
<BOS> Return the vacuum and buy her jewelry. <EOS>
<BOS> My long term goal is to save enough to buy one in 10 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I've always wanted my own home. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a couple of days.  <EOS>
<BOS> I'll bring you cat food, bowls, and toys tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! <EOS>
<BOS> Can you explain something to me? <EOS>
<BOS> What is Halloween? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it the same date every year? <EOS>
<BOS> What do people do on that day? <EOS>
<BOS> Even strangers' homes? <EOS>
<BOS> Do adults do it, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Isn't that unsafe? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. My son wants to do it this year. I didn't know what it was. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I guess it's a new tradition we have to learn. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have the receipt? <EOS>
<BOS> This was a sale item.  We do not give refunds on sale items. <EOS>
<BOS> It's on the receipt. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry, but that is our store policy. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you trying to work out? <EOS>
<BOS> How's it going? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  I need to relax. <EOS>
<BOS> I have the same problem. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Susan. How are you? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think so. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but I still feel uncomfortable about it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I feel the same way. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a great idea. Have you ever been to New York? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's plan to do that. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll think about it. <EOS>
<BOS> You went to the game? <EOS>
<BOS> It was a good game to watch. It was really close. <EOS>
<BOS> Were people getting angry? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's crazy! People like that always ruin the fun for everyone. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! <EOS>
<BOS> I would've been so upset. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like it was an interesting game. <EOS>
<BOS> At least our team won. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Steven. Nothing much. I don't have any plans yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What did you have in mind? <EOS>
<BOS> Want to go to the movies? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's check the Internet. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to see a comedy or a drama? <EOS>
<BOS> I agree. Work was stressful for me too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's all I see too. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds great. What time? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! I'll meet you at your house at 5 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> David has an annoying habit of singing while he's working. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It's so distracting too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, but he keeps doing it. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think David hears himself.  He always has earphones on. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is she moving? <EOS>
<BOS> Where is she moving? <EOS>
<BOS> There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone. <EOS>
<BOS> I know you will. When are they moving? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a good plan. <EOS>
<BOS> It's pretty far from us. We don't know anyone there. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe we won.  <EOS>
<BOS> We celebrated last night. <EOS>
<BOS> I watched the news to see the highlights of the game. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I join you? <EOS>
<BOS> I was stuck in traffic.  There was a big accident. <EOS>
<BOS> I saw a few ambulances. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I didn't hear my alarm clock. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Mom. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't.  Companies in our industry only hire people that have connections.   <EOS>
<BOS> No.  How do I meet people in the industry? <EOS>
<BOS> Isn't there a charity golf tournament coming up? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have any advice? <EOS>
<BOS> Great!  This year we're doing a raffle and gift bags. <EOS>
<BOS> The raffle prize is a sports car and the gift bags are filled with jewelry. <EOS>
<BOS> The CEO wants to keep our clients happy.   <EOS>
<BOS> It'll probably attract more clients to our company too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It was a lot of fun. But now my tummy hurts. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. <EOS>
<BOS> Pizza, cake, ice cream, and potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> I also had soda, cookies, and popcorn. <EOS>
<BOS> I was hungry and everything looked delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, mommy. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to go to the bathroom first. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Mom. How are you doing? <EOS>
<BOS> What can I help you with this year? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Is there anything else? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Will our cousins be joining us? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. How many pumpkin pies should I bring? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Are you roasting a big turkey this year? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's big. <EOS>
<BOS> Mom. I have a confession. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't make my pumpkin pies. I buy them at the market. <EOS>
<BOS> We're launching a new brand of clothing. <EOS>
<BOS> We are making children's clothes. <EOS>
<BOS> We want the logo to be unique, but cute. <EOS>
<BOS> Both. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like people messing with my things. <EOS>
<BOS> My stapler was not in the right place.   <EOS>
<BOS> Let's talk to the apartment manager again. <EOS>
<BOS> Then we should move. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, we have to choose between cheap rent or a quiet apartment. <EOS>
<BOS> No, it's not.  We can find another cheap place. <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you, Monica. My name is Paul. I live on the third floor, apartment number 305. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, you live right above me. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ok. It doesn't bother me. Have you met any of the other neighbors? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Every month, we have a party on the rooftop. It's a potluck, so you can bring a dish to share. <EOS>
<BOS> Our next one is on Saturday at 5 pm. You should come. I'm bringing my famous pasta salad. <EOS>
<BOS> I love chocolate cake. I can't wait to try it. <EOS>
<BOS> There should be an invitation in your mailbox. Everyone gets one. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need help moving any more furniture? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let me know if you need help. See you at the party. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm transferring to a new department. <EOS>
<BOS> Not really.  I like being in Customer Service, but they need help in Accounting. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you prepared to do that? <EOS>
<BOS> Can we postpone the meeting? <EOS>
<BOS> Are they helpful? <EOS>
<BOS> You learn very fast.   <EOS>
<BOS> You should have no problem passing the test. <EOS>
<BOS> I can help you if you need help. <EOS>
<BOS> I was sick.   <EOS>
<BOS> I heard about our new client. <EOS>
<BOS> Did our boss see him? <EOS>
<BOS> He must be really embarrassed this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> The food was delicious. It was the best seafood I ever had. <EOS>
<BOS> The service was excellent. The waiter was attentive and very polite. <EOS>
<BOS> Definitely. I will take you next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. Are you feeling any better? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you hungry? <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you feel better soon, so I can take you there. <EOS>
<BOS> I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work. <EOS>
<BOS> I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I use it for my business. <EOS>
<BOS> I've been here since 8 am. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. It's been a long wait. <EOS>
<BOS> Many people left. They were tired of waiting. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. See you another time. <EOS>
<BOS> Kevin. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need any help? <EOS>
<BOS> You just got here. <EOS>
<BOS> You should cut your hair.  It's old-fashioned.   <EOS>
<BOS> Try something new. <EOS>
<BOS> It's just hair.  It will grow back. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go to the salon now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I finished it last night. How about you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need any help? <EOS>
<BOS> No. I'm sorry. It's my aunt and uncle's anniversary and I promised to babysit my niece. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm free tomorrow night. <EOS>
<BOS> It might be quieter at your house. My brother is going to have a friend over and they can be very noisy. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds good. What time should I come over? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? I'd love to come for dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> Spaghetti and meatballs. But please make anything you like. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds great! I will be there tomorrow at 5 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> I asked for a room with a view.  This room has no view. <EOS>
<BOS> When I made the reservation, I paid for a room with a view. <EOS>
<BOS> This is unacceptable. <EOS>
<BOS> Our company does a lot of business with this hotel.  I will be telling my boss about this. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's divide the work this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I'll take the other half home. <EOS>
<BOS> That should make things go faster. <EOS>
<BOS> I think if we divide the work, we will finish by Monday. <EOS>
<BOS> I'd like to run my own restaurant.  <EOS>
<BOS> You need to have money and a good business mind too. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to save a lot of money.  It's my long term goal. <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully in 7 years.  I'll be thirty years old then. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of business? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That's cool!  How do you make money? <EOS>
<BOS> My dog sitter is sick.  Could you watch my dog for a few days? <EOS>
<BOS> For three days. <EOS>
<BOS> Twice a day, please. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! <EOS>
<BOS> Who? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't act like you didn't notice. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Helen. What's up? <EOS>
<BOS> That's wonderful idea. How can I help? <EOS>
<BOS> Her friends and co-workers? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I don't. Why don't we ask Dad? He should have them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Remember he surprised her with a trip to France a couple of years ago? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of food should we serve? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I can take care of the party decorations. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Do you want to meet right now? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. That sounds good. <EOS>
<BOS> This one has a small tear in it.  Can you give me a discount?   <EOS>
<BOS> I'll take it! <EOS>
<BOS> What grade are you getting right now? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. What is the extra credit homework? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow. 10 pages is long. When is it due? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you can do it. Have you chosen a president? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great choice. <EOS>
<BOS> You can search online too. <EOS>
<BOS> That should be enough information. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I guess it's not supposed to be easy since it's extra credit. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. I have to check. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you need a lantern for? <EOS>
<BOS> We went camping last month. <EOS>
<BOS> It was great! Sunny all weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good. Why are you going camping if it's going to rain? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure you will still have fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me check on that lantern. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> How do you do it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have any other advice? <EOS>
<BOS> That's hard for me.  I have so much to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to do that.  I want to have some fun in my life too. <EOS>
<BOS> But you said it was an accident. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's not good. <EOS>
<BOS> That's like stealing. <EOS>
<BOS> How did you lose it? <EOS>
<BOS> Was it an expensive necklace? <EOS>
<BOS> What does it look like? <EOS>
<BOS> Like this one? <EOS>
<BOS> The price tag says $100. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to buy it? <EOS>
<BOS> Hello, Ms. Lee.  How can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry about that.  I will change your room right away.  <EOS>
<BOS> Can we just buy a new sink? <EOS>
<BOS> No, it is not.  It is leaking again. <EOS>
<BOS> We've fixed it three times already. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to find a part-time job this summer. I want to buy a new guitar, but I don't have enough money. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I do yard work for our house all the time. What do you need done? <EOS>
<BOS> I can do both of those things. <EOS>
<BOS> I see. <EOS>
<BOS> I can start right now! <EOS>
<BOS> Mrs. Bailey. <EOS>
<BOS> May I ask how much the pay is? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds great! Thank you, Mrs. Bailey. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to! I will start mowing now. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We're merging with a well-known company.  It will look good on our resumes.  <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you have to be so negative?  <EOS>
<BOS> No. What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Is he ok? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. I had the flu, so I haven't seen or talked to anyone lately. How's Judy? <EOS>
<BOS> She must be devastated. <EOS>
<BOS> Have you seen him? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's serious. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh my goodness. What is she going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. I better visit him soon. Thanks for the information. <EOS>
<BOS> How exciting! <EOS>
<BOS> Is the baby a boy or a girl? <EOS>
<BOS> Three months? So, the baby is due in June? <EOS>
<BOS> I have three. Two grandsons and one granddaughter. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, they do. I love when they visit. <EOS>
<BOS> But the baby hasn't been born yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Maybe I'll get something for my grandkids too. Let me grab my purse. <EOS>
<BOS> I got something new today. It looks like a tuna sandwich. I'm not sure I like it. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! But will your mom get mad? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you ever buy the school lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> It's actually not bad. Some dishes are pretty good. <EOS>
<BOS> The spaghetti and pizza are good. But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible. They taste like cardboard. <EOS>
<BOS> They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Let's go! <EOS>
<BOS> Which one? <EOS>
<BOS> Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> The market is going out of business? <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But it has a bigger selection of things. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's go somewhere warm.  <EOS>
<BOS> How about the beach?  My co-worker owns a condo on the beach. <EOS>
<BOS> He said he would give us a discount on the cost. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> I'm entering the talent show. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to juggle while sitting on a unicycle. I know how to juggle really well. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to use my grandfather's unicycle. He used to ride one in the circus. <EOS>
<BOS> You do. Think of something you're really good at. <EOS>
<BOS> Magic tricks are cool! You should enter. The winner gets a new computer. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never been on stage either. I think it will be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! Do you want to watch me practice? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! Let's go practice together at my house tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. What kind of food do you want to eat? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I've never had Indian food before, so you'll have to choose the place. <EOS>
<BOS> Then why do you want to go there? <EOS>
<BOS> Let's check out the reviews online. <EOS>
<BOS> There are many restaurants we haven't tried. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. That will be fun. <EOS>
<BOS> What about next week? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm hungry. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  That's a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> How about next Tuesday? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm on a business trip on Wednesday.  I will be back Friday morning. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure.  I'll put it in my calendar. <EOS>
<BOS> Dogs are loyal and obedient. <EOS>
<BOS> Dogs are cute and cuddly too.    <EOS>
<BOS> Dogs are smart too.  <EOS>
<BOS> I've seen many service dogs, but I've never seen a service cat before.  Have you? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that would be great! <EOS>
<BOS> I have a project due this Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> How much free time do you have? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much, Brittany.  I will tell your boss she has a great employee! <EOS>
<BOS> She complains about everything. <EOS>
<BOS> If she's so unhappy, she should find another job. <EOS>
<BOS> 50 years. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. They got married in their early twenties. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't we throw them a surprise party? We can invite all of our relatives. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's make a slideshow of their life together. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure Mom has a lot of pictures we can go through. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we'll need her help. <EOS>
<BOS> Too bad we aren't doing this next year. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> How about a horror movie? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want see a comedy or a drama? <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds good.  I don't care what we watch. <EOS>
<BOS> I am. I went to that college. <EOS>
<BOS> What year did you graduate? <EOS>
<BOS> I studied Law. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm Matthew, by the way. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to the game tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> I have an extra ticket. Would you like to go to the game with me? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! What about dinner first? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll meet you at this coffee shop at 5 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> $500. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to pay the rent. <EOS>
<BOS> He is so negative. <EOS>
<BOS> He has such a poor attitude.  He is against everything. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know.  I don't see anything. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  Can you try to change it for a later time? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  The cars are moving again. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I will see you soon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  He's a nice guy, but he's very disorganized. <EOS>
<BOS> Be flexible because he changes his mind often. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it can.  But have a good attitude about it. <EOS>
<BOS> He was arrested for drugs. <EOS>
<BOS> It's been all over the news. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not surprised he was caught with drugs. <EOS>
<BOS> They are going to lay off several people this month. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard it from Bill. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I've only been here for six months. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Everyone likes you here. <EOS>
<BOS> You did?  I don't think the receptionist told Sharon. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  Sharon is really angry.  She needed that report for her meeting with the president. <EOS>
<BOS> You had better tell Sharon. <EOS>
<BOS> 5PM. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I'm sorry about that. <EOS>
<BOS> His hotel is downtown. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, please.  Would you also be able to take him out to dinner?   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.   You can borrow the company car. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I can choose my own hours. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  I love donuts and coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> I like to add cream and sugar. <EOS>
<BOS> The line is long.  There are a lot of people here. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope they don't run out of donuts. <EOS>
<BOS> Raw oysters. <EOS>
<BOS> They're delicious. <EOS>
<BOS> 10 minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have time to wait.  I'm going to take the stairs. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't care.  I'm going to be late for work. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok, but you're wearing high heels. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck. <EOS>
<BOS> I like the blue one better.   <EOS>
<BOS> This is an expensive purchase. <EOS>
<BOS> I promise I won't change my mind. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure?  What is wrong with the red one? <EOS>
<BOS> I can cook our favorite meals. <EOS>
<BOS> Your cooking isn't very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I will make spaghetti and meatballs tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'll use a recipe. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  You've been on the phone for 15 minutes.   <EOS>
<BOS> We have a lot of customers waiting right now. <EOS>
<BOS> You make too many personal calls during work. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I should let you know that your customer is the boss's daughter. <EOS>
<BOS> What size do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> Let me see if we have any more. <EOS>
<BOS> We only have one more in stock. <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to look at anything else? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it cheaper? <EOS>
<BOS> How much is shipping?   <EOS>
<BOS> It looked so real. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not feeling well. <EOS>
<BOS> Sorry. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! Where were their parents? <EOS>
<BOS> How old are the kids? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you complain to them? <EOS>
<BOS> What did they do? <EOS>
<BOS> That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police? <EOS>
<BOS> I bet that ended the party. <EOS>
<BOS> Do they know what happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I need to replace it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we called a repairman yesterday. He said that it would cost more to repair than to replace it. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I appreciated that. We really can't afford to buy a new one right now. We just had a baby a couple of months ago. But I really need one. <EOS>
<BOS> Where can I get a used one that's in good condition? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't care what color it is. I just want one that works well. Do you know how much it is? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll talk to my husband too. He may not want a used one. He's a little picky about appliances. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it far from here? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great distance.  It's not too far or too near. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean? <EOS>
<BOS> Who has been affected? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor? <EOS>
<BOS> What did you do all night? <EOS>
<BOS> I would be so angry. You should've called the police. <EOS>
<BOS> I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone. <EOS>
<BOS> That's annoying. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Carol. Is that your neighbor? He's walking towards us. <EOS>
<BOS> It looks like a plate of cookies. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you work from home? <EOS>
<BOS> You're so lucky. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a very understanding boss. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to work from home.  The traffic to work is terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> A bowl, a vase, and a mug. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, it's a lot of fun. I'm going to make each member of my family a cup. <EOS>
<BOS> It's going to be their Christmas gifts. <EOS>
<BOS> It was hard at first, but then I got used to the pottery wheel. <EOS>
<BOS> I like taking lots of different classes. I get bored. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe one day after you retire, you'll have some time. <EOS>
<BOS> It is, but it can be boring. I always have to find something to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I do. My hobbies are sewing, quilting, scrapbooking, and now pottery-making. <EOS>
<BOS> I do. My closet is full of them. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? You have such a beautiful voice. <EOS>
<BOS> You sing so well. You could probably get a solo. <EOS>
<BOS> You're wasting your talent. If I could sing like you, I would join the Choir. <EOS>
<BOS> You should think about it again. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe this is great way to overcome your fear. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should join. You'll make a great addition to the club. <EOS>
<BOS> The choir teacher thinks you should join. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, she has. I recorded your singing and let her listen to it. <EOS>
<BOS> She loved it! She said you have an amazing voice. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I've been working every weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> They are not happy about it. <EOS>
<BOS> Did anyone get hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> Do we need to evacuate the building? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you told your parents? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you have to tell them. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you go to summer school? <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck, buddy. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but stocks can be risky. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what I'm worried about. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess it's a gamble. <EOS>
<BOS> You also have to be lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> On my desk. I was working on it and then I decided to take a break. <EOS>
<BOS> It's due tomorrow. What am I going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> But I didn't take it off my desk. <EOS>
<BOS> Outside. I took a walk to get some fresh air. <EOS>
<BOS> I got a snack from the kitchen. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. That's my homework. <EOS>
<BOS> I must've taken it to the kitchen when I grabbed a snack. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  She just got married last month. <EOS>
<BOS> Celebrities never stay married. <EOS>
<BOS> How is that going? <EOS>
<BOS> I love sweets too much.   <EOS>
<BOS> Nice to meet you Ted.  I think I spoke with you on the phone last week. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that was it.  Thanks for fixing the problem quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> We did that last week. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, the mall is having great sales. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? My kids are still wearing the same size. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's amazing! <EOS>
<BOS> Probably because she is growing. Do you need to buy school supplies, too? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad I'm done. The mall was really crowded last week. I think everyone is shopping for school. <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck! I hope you find everything you need. <EOS>
<BOS> What about drinks after work? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you stay late every night? <EOS>
<BOS> You work too much. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you think that's a problem? <EOS>
<BOS> You'd better go home! <EOS>
<BOS> It's not staying cold. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'm worried that my food is going to spoil. I just went grocery shopping yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> You have two refrigerators? <EOS>
<BOS> Is the sale still going on? I may need to buy a new one. <EOS>
<BOS> Then I better tell my husband. We need to go today. <EOS>
<BOS> It's getting old. I'd rather buy a new one. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't cook that much. <EOS>
<BOS> Just a gallon, please. <EOS>
<BOS> No, nothing else. <EOS>
<BOS> Our hotel lost our reservations? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation. <EOS>
<BOS> No. They said there are no more rooms available. <EOS>
<BOS> We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel. <EOS>
<BOS> There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit. <EOS>
<BOS> No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations. <EOS>
<BOS> They just kept apologizing. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer. <EOS>
<BOS> One of your sales clerks was very rude to me. <EOS>
<BOS> His name is Bob.  He works in the mornings. <EOS>
<BOS> It did. Have you made a New Year's resolution yet? <EOS>
<BOS> A goal you want to set or achieve in the New Year. Haven't you ever made a New Year's resolution? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! <EOS>
<BOS> No, I hardly ever achieve them. <EOS>
<BOS> One year was losing weight. Another year, I was going to quit smoking. There are too many to list. <EOS>
<BOS> I should at least try to achieve one goal. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me think about it. I don't think so. <EOS>
<BOS> Great idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> When will it be ready? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm late again and I don't want my boss to know. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  Does he see me? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> You'll be fine. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  That's what I heard too. <EOS>
<BOS> Just be prepared. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure!  Let's get started now. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I've never felt an earthquake before? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to look around and see how bad the damage is. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. Don't go outside. The power is down. There could be power lines on the ground. <EOS>
<BOS> I found them. They're both under the bed. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish we could watch the news. I want to know how much damage this earthquake caused. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it's in the garage. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Let me get them. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that was a big mistake. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> How did that happen? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> That pesticide is toxic. You should be careful. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. My parents had an ant problem a couple of years ago. They used that stuff too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but it smelled bad for a few days. They were getting headaches. They came to stay with me. <EOS>
<BOS> You can stay with us if you want. <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> Those are very high hopes. <EOS>
<BOS> I absolutely agree, but they are not realistic. <EOS>
<BOS> We will have to change the future for them, but how? <EOS>
<BOS> The world needs good leaders in the future. <EOS>
<BOS> It's beautiful.  Do you like it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's not good.  What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Brown-nosing the boss. <EOS>
<BOS> He treats the boss like a king and does everything he says. <EOS>
<BOS> It's ridiculous. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't like him.  He just wants a promotion. <EOS>
<BOS> She says all of her friends have one even a nine-year old named Sally. <EOS>
<BOS> I think it would be a good idea in case of an emergency. <EOS>
<BOS> Everything.  Nothing is going right. <EOS>
<BOS> My model keeps falling apart. <EOS>
<BOS> This is the only glue I have. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Dad! <EOS>
<BOS> It is so slow. <EOS>
<BOS> I can hear it stopping on other floors. <EOS>
<BOS> Could you fill in for me today? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not feeling that well. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks.  Your first haircut client is Carol at 10 AM. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I don't want to be rude. <EOS>
<BOS> Was anyone hurt? <EOS>
<BOS> That's terrible. <EOS>
<BOS> That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident? <EOS>
<BOS> You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> That was smart. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no! <EOS>
<BOS> I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't we take her out to lunch and discuss things? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know her favorite food or restaurant? <EOS>
<BOS> Find the best French restaurant in the city. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm going to try to negotiate a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> I've worked here for two years and haven't received a raise yet. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, that needs to change.  Do you have any tips for me? <EOS>
<BOS> I know exactly what I'm going to say and I'm ready! <EOS>
<BOS> What does that mean for my loan? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't afford higher payments. <EOS>
<BOS> I will have to wait for the rates to go back down. <EOS>
<BOS> Will you contact me when the rates are lower? <EOS>
<BOS> I know! I'm going to miss him. <EOS>
<BOS> Next Friday. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I heard his doctor told him to retire immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Let's talk to the other employees and plan it. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard it was going to be Bob. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. People are not going to be happy. <EOS>
<BOS> Who is going to be on the call? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  Are you nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> He hasn't paid a single bill. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's too bad. What are you going to do for Thanksgiving then? <EOS>
<BOS> But the college campus will be closed and most of our friends will be going home for the weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> That's not fun. Would you like to come over to my house this weekend? <EOS>
<BOS> Don't be silly. You won't be a burden. My mom always makes too much food. All of relatives come over. We have a great time. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I'm sure. We have plenty of room too. <EOS>
<BOS> You're welcome! Now, you better start packing. I'm leaving soon. <EOS>
<BOS> 3 o'clock. It's a three hour drive from here. <EOS>
<BOS> We can each pay half. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. Mark says he has a special surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> I have no idea. Maybe dinner at a nice restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, we've both been so busy at work. Our first year of marriage went by very fast. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been married? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a long time. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! I hope Mark and I will celebrate a 25-year anniversary one day. <EOS>
<BOS> I just got a text from Mark. He said to put on a nice dress and dancing shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a huge surprise. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  I got two tickets from my boss.  She can't go. <EOS>
<BOS> I only have two tickets. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't give up these tickets.  They're front row seats! <EOS>
<BOS> Don't you want to buy a concert T-shirt? <EOS>
<BOS> We'll get her one and tell her that my boss got them for us. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> I know where it is. I've been there before. It's a fun place. <EOS>
<BOS> There are a lot of fun roller coasters to ride on. <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad. But why are you taking your school books home? <EOS>
<BOS> You're going to do homework on vacation? <EOS>
<BOS> You're a good student. <EOS>
<BOS> I would be against it. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's quite a gift! <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to buy a new or used car? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm actually selling my car. Would you be interested? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's the one. <EOS>
<BOS> It's in great condition. I've taken good care of it. <EOS>
<BOS> 35,000 miles. $7,000. <EOS>
<BOS> My wife and I are having a baby. We need to get a bigger car. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. Would you like to take a look at the car? <EOS>
<BOS> Of course. <EOS>
<BOS> No, but I can learn. <EOS>
<BOS> My son has a smartwatch.  It looks cool. <EOS>
<BOS> What about the employees' stocks? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you serious? <EOS>
<BOS> What am I going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> That was going to be my retirement fund. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Someone is leaving dog poop in our yard. <EOS>
<BOS> It has happened twice already. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to set up a secret video recorder in our yard. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to deliver their dog's mess to them and show them the video. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  I hate negotiating.  I want it to be over quickly. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true.  I made a bad deal once because I was in a hurry. <EOS>
<BOS> That's also true.  This is great advice. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you!  These are great negotiating tips! <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We are going to remodel the office. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Some areas are too small and some are just a waste of space. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  That's a lot of stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> But don't you want to try clothes and shoes on before you buy them? <EOS>
<BOS> That's seems like a waste of time to me. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have one? <EOS>
<BOS> How much are they? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could get one. <EOS>
<BOS> If it's on my wrist, then maybe I will use it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you need to raise money? <EOS>
<BOS> How are you going to try to raise money? <EOS>
<BOS> A car wash? Where and how? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea! Can parents help, too? <EOS>
<BOS> When is the car wash? <EOS>
<BOS> What will the weather be like on Saturday? <EOS>
<BOS> According to the weather report, it's going to be clear and sunny. <EOS>
<BOS> How many posters are you going to make? <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going to hang these posters? <EOS>
<BOS> He follows Greg everywhere. <EOS>
<BOS> It's so annoying.  He says bad things about Greg all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> No, that's ok. I've never gone hiking before. <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds fun and good for you. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't even have the correct shoes. <EOS>
<BOS> I wear a size 7. <EOS>
<BOS> What else do I need? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a lot of stuff to bring. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. <EOS>
<BOS> How long are you going to be hiking? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea. <EOS>
<BOS> We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves. <EOS>
<BOS> Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but he adds on interest. <EOS>
<BOS> He wants to be a banker one day. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to expand my contacts and meet new people. <EOS>
<BOS> What's the best way to network? <EOS>
<BOS> Good idea! <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds fun! So, why do you look nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> Really? Who did you hire? <EOS>
<BOS> Natalie? Carol's daughter? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. She used to babysit my children a couple of years ago. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. She was a very responsible girl. <EOS>
<BOS> You can trust her. She babysits for a few people I know. <EOS>
<BOS> She loves children. She wants to go to medical school and become a pediatric doctor. <EOS>
<BOS> She is. She was a straight A student in high school and she has been accepted to many colleges. <EOS>
<BOS> She's babysitting a lot to save money for college tuition. <EOS>
<BOS> He's been talking to a bankruptcy lawyer. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to start looking for another job. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not taking any chances.   <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need to go to the post office? <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you sending your package? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a big package? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. Today is Monday. Most people go on Monday since the post office is closed on Sunday. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's a better idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. <EOS>
<BOS> Is this your first business trip? <EOS>
<BOS> Just socialize.  Get to know them.  Go out for drinks one night. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good.  Don't stress about it so much. <EOS>
<BOS> Then don't get drunk. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you'll have more things to worry about. <EOS>
<BOS> We would like you to join our team. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  We would like you to join our company. <EOS>
<BOS> My secretary will email you the job description and our salary offer. <EOS>
<BOS> We would like an answer by the end of the week. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  I think I need to lie down. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I need to go to the restroom. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I have room for dessert. <EOS>
<BOS> Today.  I got it on sale. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  It's a one-day sale.  You should check it out. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I join you? <EOS>
<BOS> I think I'll get one for my mom too. <EOS>
<BOS> How about the lake? <EOS>
<BOS> What should we pack for lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> Yummy. I love ham sandwiches and potato salad. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I think it is going to get hot later today. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll tell Cindy and Alison to wear their swimsuits. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Will Andy be joining us? <EOS>
<BOS> He's taking a nap on the couch. <EOS>
<BOS> You can wake him up. I'll get my sisters. <EOS>
<BOS> I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now. The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people. <EOS>
<BOS> How long have you been out of work? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of work do you do? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you thought about opening your own business? <EOS>
<BOS> I understand. If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know. <EOS>
<BOS> Why did you leave your last job? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you should've stayed until you found another job. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. You'll find one soon. Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> That's so sweet! Those are long-stemmed roses. <EOS>
<BOS> How many are there? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That must've been expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there one in the kitchen? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that bouquet is huge. You're a lucky woman. I wish my boyfriend would send me flowers. Is it a special occasion? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know why he sent them? <EOS>
<BOS> Why do you think he sent them? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh! Now, I understand. <EOS>
<BOS> We aren't ready. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but we're just not ready. <EOS>
<BOS> I understand that, but we need more time. <EOS>
<BOS> Please ask them for one more week. <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so sorry. I'm not available. We have tickets to the play tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Jenny is home from college this weekend. Would you like me to ask her if she is available? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll ask her when she gets home. She went to the store. She should be back in a few minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she loves children. She is studying to become a teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> If Michael has homework, she can help him with it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. He may not like Jenny after tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you believe another year has passed? <EOS>
<BOS> You had some bad luck last year, didn't you? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe all of that happened in one year. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sure it will be. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great! Looks like good luck is coming your way. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, Jill and I are expecting our first child. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks, Tom. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! We can toast to a Happy New Year. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. I'm still working on it. <EOS>
<BOS> I am. I've been stuck on a problem for an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! I cannot figure it out! Have you? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to work on it together? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want me to go there? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. Do you want to discuss it over the phone? <EOS>
<BOS> Nothing. I didn't know where to begin. <EOS>
<BOS> What are we going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> No. They're not home either. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I don't like him. <EOS>
<BOS> Rude comments about people. <EOS>
<BOS> He's our boss's friend. <EOS>
<BOS> You need to exercise too. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great.   <EOS>
<BOS> What should I do? <EOS>
<BOS> We should do salad too. <EOS>
<BOS> Some of our friends are vegetarians. <EOS>
<BOS> We can have a salad bar with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and other things. <EOS>
<BOS> We can all have salad. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you do there? <EOS>
<BOS> What are spreadsheets? <EOS>
<BOS> It sounds complicated. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like your job? <EOS>
<BOS> You should. You deserve a raise. You work very hard. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've helped me many times. <EOS>
<BOS> Three years? Then I think it's definitely time for a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> I think she will. She is nice. She listens well and she is also very fair. <EOS>
<BOS> Only you would do that. You are so detail-oriented. <EOS>
<BOS> That's another reason why you should get a raise. <EOS>
<BOS> You can't talk to her today. <EOS>
<BOS> She's on a business trip. <EOS>
<BOS> Does it bother you? <EOS>
<BOS> What about your social life? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Why? Did he cut himself? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds painful. <EOS>
<BOS> What about his finger? <EOS>
<BOS> I hate the ER. It is always crowded and takes too long. <EOS>
<BOS> How many stitches did he get? <EOS>
<BOS> Is that a good thing? <EOS>
<BOS> They are very moist and tasty. <EOS>
<BOS> She puts parmesan cheese in the mixture. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to eat meatballs tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We need to go to the grocery market. <EOS>
<BOS> Well, our boss didn't give me a raise when I asked for one. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not funny at all. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  It was boring. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you looking for anything special? <EOS>
<BOS> We just bought a new sofa. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it was on sale. You should go check it out. <EOS>
<BOS> We went to the new store across the street. <EOS>
<BOS> If you bring the flyer, you get 10% off this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know what kind of sofa you want? <EOS>
<BOS> That's exactly what we bought. <EOS>
<BOS> I come out here once in a while to look at the stars. Aren't they beautiful? <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky tonight. The sky is clear, so the stars are very bright. <EOS>
<BOS> That's awesome. I wish we had one. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great! I've always been interested in astronomy. <EOS>
<BOS> Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I took a college class in astronomy once. It was fascinating. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, didn't you see it earlier tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> It's supposed to be clear tomorrow night too. Do you want to meet out here again? <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be here. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I studied English more as a kid. <EOS>
<BOS> Spelling and grammar. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have this problem. <EOS>
<BOS> It is a big deal to Gloria.  She's one of the managers. <EOS>
<BOS> She wants to make a good first impression. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  This will be her first time meeting him. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to change some of the terms in a contract. <EOS>
<BOS> What else? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so busy at work.  I'm forgetting about my personal life. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you balance it all out? <EOS>
<BOS> It's not that easy. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's my problem.  I feel sick all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you selling? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you selling the rowing machine? <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you use it? <EOS>
<BOS> Why didn't you return it to the store? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a nice phone. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to get a new one too. My phone is old. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be great. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry. I will. <EOS>
<BOS> I like your phone. How much did it cost? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's too much for me. I think I will wait for a sale. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, happy birthday! <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  But, I didn't quite understand what he meant. <EOS>
<BOS> That's ridiculous. <EOS>
<BOS> The company made a profit too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to ask for a clear explanation. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know what these numbers mean. <EOS>
<BOS> The explanations are not very clear. <EOS>
<BOS> Susan went their last weekend and said it was the best breakfast place in town. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I can wait an hour. I'm hungry right now. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What do you want to eat? <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds good. Do we have all of the ingredients? <EOS>
<BOS> I think we may be out of ham. I used the last few slices for a sandwich yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good too. We have green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! I'll brew some coffee and you make the omelet. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't? Well, I don't either. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a better plan. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  We bumped into each other at the store. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  She moved back last month. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm single now, so I asked her on a date. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  We have more catching up to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Nursing. <EOS>
<BOS> My mother was a nurse too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, she is. We are all proud of her. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. She got a job at the hospital already. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you doing anything special to celebrate? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's an awesome gift! <EOS>
<BOS> That's smart. <EOS>
<BOS> In a month. <EOS>
<BOS> She's going backpacking with a friend in Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. Kids grow up too fast. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's tell her we're sick. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  We're roommates.  She'll believe it. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  It's Friday night. <EOS>
<BOS> Come on.  Brad is going to be there. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it that bad? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a hard class. <EOS>
<BOS> You should think about the good grades you received. Don't worry about one class. <EOS>
<BOS> Just study harder next time. You can do it. <EOS>
<BOS> I did well. I was most worried about math. <EOS>
<BOS> Better than I expected. But not a perfect grade. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I did ok. <EOS>
<BOS> I did really well. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a dentist appointment. <EOS>
<BOS> It's just a check-up. <EOS>
<BOS> That is because you had a cavity. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but you eat too much candy. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. <EOS>
<BOS> 2 o'clock. <EOS>
<BOS> I will also call the school office. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work. <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky! <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my boss. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like an interesting topic. <EOS>
<BOS> I like that idea. What are the choices? <EOS>
<BOS> Where do you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> Didn't you go to the zoo last year? <EOS>
<BOS> You may want to try something new this year. The museum is a great place too. You can learn a lot there. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. It's your choice. The museum is having a display of old airplanes. <EOS>
<BOS> You have a tough decision. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  There were recruiters from many companies. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  They were generous with their time.  They gave us all really good advice. <EOS>
<BOS> Is this your first trip to Seattle? <EOS>
<BOS> You promised we could get one when I got older. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I promise to help take care of it. <EOS>
<BOS> I promise to do all of those things. <EOS>
<BOS> But mom doesn't want a dog. She doesn't like them. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is she afraid of dogs? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. But if we get a puppy, we can train it not to bite. <EOS>
<BOS> Dad, did you have a dog when you were a kid? <EOS>
<BOS> How old were you? <EOS>
<BOS> Dad, I'm eleven years old. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't believe our computers were hacked. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard the Customer Service department is being flooded with calls. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What does she like? <EOS>
<BOS> What would you like to buy her? A purse, makeup, shoes, clothes, perfume? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you know her clothing size? <EOS>
<BOS> What about her shoe size? <EOS>
<BOS> I see. Should we look at purses then? What is her taste? Does she like leather? <EOS>
<BOS> What is her favorite color? <EOS>
<BOS> When is your wife's birthday? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm a sales executive.  My boss is Susan Smith. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I was hoping to meet you. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, sir.  I am the best sales executive in my department. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> How can you say it's boring? <EOS>
<BOS> I have to watch, read, or listen to the news every day. <EOS>
<BOS> My vocabulary isn't very good. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to look a lot of words up in the dictionary when I read books. <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you always so busy? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  Did I make you upset? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I help you? <EOS>
<BOS> You need to make time for yourself. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you loved hanging out there.   <EOS>
<BOS> Well, I feel like relaxing with a cup of coffee. <EOS>
<BOS> That sounds like a good compromise.   <EOS>
<BOS> Haha.  That is fair. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'm just sharing news. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a problem with it? <EOS>
<BOS> What's the big deal? <EOS>
<BOS> I guess I never thought about that. <EOS>
<BOS> What happened? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  I can't believe it! <EOS>
<BOS> That is awful!  What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh no!  Sam wants to see me in his office. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need a ride? <EOS>
<BOS> Get in the car.  You're all wet. <EOS>
<BOS> My husband is having surgery that day. <EOS>
<BOS> It's not serious, but I need to stay home with him. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you stay late at work every day? <EOS>
<BOS> You're becoming a workaholic. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> Meeting any important people? <EOS>
<BOS> Well, you're definitely dressed to impress. <EOS>
<BOS> This Saturday.  Are you available? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too bad.  What time is the party? <EOS>
<BOS> We can see the late showing at 10. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's meet at the theater at 9 <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Would you like it spicy or non-spicy? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like white rice or fried rice? <EOS>
<BOS> No, this is a Chinese restaurant. <EOS>
<BOS> No, our daily special is Mongolian beef with rice. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have a flier showing a cheaper price? <EOS>
<BOS> If you can show me a lower price for the exact model, I can match that price. <EOS>
<BOS> I see.  I will match that price. <EOS>
<BOS> Our office opens at 8 AM.  Can you start at 8? <EOS>
<BOS> 9 AM is a little late for our company.  This may be a problem. <EOS>
<BOS> Carl, I completely understand.  I'm a single parent too.   <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  So I will discuss it with the other managers and ask them to let you start at 9 AM. <EOS>
<BOS> I need to leave tomorrow morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I would prefer a direct flight.   <EOS>
<BOS> I'll take it.   <EOS>
<BOS> Don't change the return flight. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you see the news? <EOS>
<BOS> The stock market is soaring. <EOS>
<BOS> It means I made a lot of money! <EOS>
<BOS> Retire early, pay off my home loan, and travel. <EOS>
<BOS> I notice we are paying a lot for delivery charges each month. <EOS>
<BOS> We've been a good customer for over five years. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you waive the delivery fee for all future orders? <EOS>
<BOS> We would love to continue doing business with you, but your delivery fees are too expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> He got fired this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. <EOS>
<BOS> He said that if he returns the money, they will not call the police. <EOS>
<BOS> Then he's going to call the police. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. He is so foolish. Why would he do this? <EOS>
<BOS> He's going to have a hard time finding another job after this. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm afraid of the ocean. <EOS>
<BOS> Also, there are sharks in the ocean. <EOS>
<BOS> If the ship sinks, we will. <EOS>
<BOS> There is a bank robbery going on. <EOS>
<BOS> You got lucky.  The robbers are still inside with hostages. <EOS>
<BOS> The robbers are demanding money and a helicopter. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you sure?  Tuesday lunch specials are the best. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Maybe next Tuesday. <EOS>
<BOS> When is your anniversary? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh dear.  How about these diamond earrings? <EOS>
<BOS> The company is laying people off? <EOS>
<BOS> The company is not making a profit. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I'm very worried. I just bought a house. <EOS>
<BOS> This is terrible. What should we do? <EOS>
<BOS> But what if it's all a rumor and not true. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> We are going through the largest recall in the company's history. <EOS>
<BOS> Airbags.  They can explode without warning. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  We have already been sued multiple times. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  We have a very bad reputation now. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> I thought your parents were on vacation in Europe. <EOS>
<BOS> How long has it been in the shop? <EOS>
<BOS> That's interesting.   <EOS>
<BOS> I saw you washing your car this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> You always try to get out of helping me. <EOS>
<BOS> He's a little nervous. <EOS>
<BOS> I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school. <EOS>
<BOS> No, he has to share with my wife. <EOS>
<BOS> No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! Our insurance rate doubled. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive. <EOS>
<BOS> In two years. <EOS>
<BOS> I think I like the part-time job idea better. <EOS>
<BOS> No, David is sick today. He couldn't go to school. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I think so. He has a cough and a sore throat. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I hope David isn't sick that long. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've been taking extra Vitamin C to stay healthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Actually, I do. I couldn't go to the store because I didn't want to leave David alone. <EOS>
<BOS> Could you please buy me a whole chicken?  I want to make David some chicken soup. <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you so much! I will pay you back when you drop off the chicken. <EOS>
<BOS> Great! See you then. Don't forget to buy Vitamin C! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Can you go? <EOS>
<BOS> The party is at 7 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you buy a gift? <EOS>
<BOS> She likes clothes and makeup. <EOS>
<BOS> I got her a red scarf. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you just get her a gift card? Then she can buy what she wants. <EOS>
<BOS> It was yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> No, you're just a busy friend. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you ask Bill if he received it? <EOS>
<BOS> Did he respond to that? <EOS>
<BOS> It's too much work to take care of. <EOS>
<BOS> They're all grown up now.   <EOS>
<BOS> We would make new memories. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I understand.  You talked me out of it. <EOS>
<BOS> Someone got caught cheating on the test. <EOS>
<BOS> Peter! <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah! <EOS>
<BOS> He wrote some things on his hand and Mrs. Jones saw it. <EOS>
<BOS> She sent him to the principal's office. I think they called his parents. I saw them walking into the school office. <EOS>
<BOS> I know! His dad is really strict. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. But if he continues to cheat, Mrs. Jones isn't going to be able to trust him anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> So, we celebrate people that work? <EOS>
<BOS> So, people have a day off from work? <EOS>
<BOS> And, schools are closed, too? <EOS>
<BOS> Is it always in September? <EOS>
<BOS> Do we do anything special on this day? <EOS>
<BOS> Is that why we always have a picnic and get together with family and friends? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad there is a day to honor hard-working people. <EOS>
<BOS> That's right. Remember we go every Sunday evening. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't be rude. She loves to cook for us. <EOS>
<BOS> Your grandfather likes it. It's his favorite, so we're going to eat it too. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't we pick up a dessert on the way to their house? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. We can make ice cream sundaes after dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> What's funny? <EOS>
<BOS> That is funny. This will be our new tradition. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a great day for it. <EOS>
<BOS> I would love to. I need to ask Paul. He's at the store. He should be home in a few minutes. <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like fun. I've never been on a boat before. <EOS>
<BOS> I've never been on a boat so I wouldn't know. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think so. I don't get sick on planes or trains or long car rides. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you really worried about me being seasick? <EOS>
<BOS> What is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. I should be ok. <EOS>
<BOS> He used to be a fisherman. He is definitely not going to be seasick. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?   <EOS>
<BOS> Then why did we come to the beach? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anything else to watch? <EOS>
<BOS> There is just too much singing. <EOS>
<BOS> How can you watch this? <EOS>
<BOS> No.  I'll stop, but I get to choose the show next time. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he will come to the next one. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I understand. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, he did? <EOS>
<BOS> What does he do? <EOS>
<BOS> That's cool! Did he design your house? <EOS>
<BOS> Hey Jane. Look! <EOS>
<BOS> Your dad is in the audience and he's waving at you! <EOS>
<BOS> Why are they the best? <EOS>
<BOS> What is the special ingredient? <EOS>
<BOS> I guess we will be working with each other. <EOS>
<BOS> Good to know.  I'm looking forward to working with you. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to meet after school and work on it together? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't tomorrow. I have soccer practice after school. I can meet on Thursday. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I'll ask my mom tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> Should we start on the project before Thursday? <EOS>
<BOS> I can work on the written portion. Do you want to do the pictures? <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I've seen your drawings before. You are very talented. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. I wish I knew how to draw well. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. But we better finish the project first. <EOS>
<BOS> Did you get a good deal on it? <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good deal. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, that's very nice. Joe loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place. <EOS>
<BOS> That's good to know. <EOS>
<BOS> Anything else? <EOS>
<BOS> Sounds like it was a wonderful place to stay. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there a restaurant in the hotel? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I'm definitely going to make a reservation here. <EOS>
<BOS> Stuffed mushrooms. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong with them? <EOS>
<BOS> Strange texture? <EOS>
<BOS> This is all I made for dinner.  You're going to be hungry.   <EOS>
<BOS> I could tell.  It was very detailed with lots of information. <EOS>
<BOS> I think she was.  I saw her smile a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> Let's get some fast food here. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that sounds good. <EOS>
<BOS> It's dinner time. Should we go inside? <EOS>
<BOS> Looks like the line is really long inside too. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we go to one closer to the concert arena? <EOS>
<BOS> There are many fast food places around there. <EOS>
<BOS> Fast food is great. Fast and cheap. <EOS>
<BOS> A solar system? <EOS>
<BOS> How about some balls? They can represent the planets and the sun. <EOS>
<BOS> I might have some. Judy had to make a solar system model a few years ago. I might have some balls left over. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what Judy did too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes! <EOS>
<BOS> It's a great project. We had a fun time doing it together. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I think scientists are still debating that issue. David should ask his teacher. <EOS>
<BOS> Let me go look for the balls. I think I still have her model in the garage too. I'll be right back. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't know? <EOS>
<BOS> It's Memorial Day. This is the day we remember the people who died serving in the United States military. <EOS>
<BOS> It's an important day. It's not just a day off from school and work. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. It's always observed on the last Monday in May. <EOS>
<BOS> It's really important in our family. My grandfather and great grandfather both served in the United States army. They both died serving this country. <EOS>
<BOS> Each year my family and I go to the cemetery and place flowers on their graves. <EOS>
<BOS> No. We go every year, so it's not scary anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. But only in the United States. It's an American holiday. Some businesses like post offices and banks close too. <EOS>
<BOS> The managers have been having secret meetings every day. <EOS>
<BOS> My hunch is that they are going to close the business. <EOS>
<BOS> I overheard the owner talking about moving to another state. <EOS>
<BOS> What do they play? <EOS>
<BOS> You must be busy with games. <EOS>
<BOS> Isn't it fun to watch? <EOS>
<BOS> I miss those days.  My kids are all in college now. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are you going to take them? <EOS>
<BOS> There's a really good sushi place downtown. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that's the one. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> No, I didn't hear that. I haven't watched the news in a few days. <EOS>
<BOS> Sandbags? Why? <EOS>
<BOS> I think I'll just evacuate if that happens. <EOS>
<BOS> You don't have any place to take them? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need help loading the sandbags into your truck? <EOS>
<BOS> I guess I should be. But every time the weather person says something terrible is going to happen, it never does. <EOS>
<BOS> Now you have me worried. <EOS>
<BOS> After my dad died I had to take over the family business. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but I still wish I had a college education. <EOS>
<BOS> It's my biggest regret in life. <EOS>
<BOS> A new bike. <EOS>
<BOS> A new car. <EOS>
<BOS> What is the logo for? <EOS>
<BOS> Who is your target audience? <EOS>
<BOS> You always change your mind at the last minute. <EOS>
<BOS> But I already bought the concert tickets. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have the order number or your receipt?   <EOS>
<BOS> I see.  I can try to look it up with your address or phone number. <EOS>
<BOS> I found your item.  It was delivered to a different address.   <EOS>
<BOS> I am very sorry for the error.  We will send a replacement table to your correct address as soon as possible.   <EOS>
<BOS> You weren't ready. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  You were not organized during the presentation. <EOS>
<BOS> We're going to the city aquarium. <EOS>
<BOS> I can't wait to go. I'm so excited! <EOS>
<BOS> Next Wednesday. My teacher needs chaperones for the trip. Can you go, Mom? <EOS>
<BOS> I hope you can chaperone. <EOS>
<BOS> We need to pack a lunch. We're going to eat at the aquarium. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great, Mom! I'll tell my teacher tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm so excited. I can't concentrate on studying. <EOS>
<BOS> But I have tickets to a game. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll do it tomorrow. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm at home.  I overslept. <EOS>
<BOS> Can you do the presentation for me?   <EOS>
<BOS> You can do it.  You helped me research the stuff. <EOS>
<BOS> Tell them I'm stuck at the airport. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  How did you lose weight? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to lose some weight too. <EOS>
<BOS> When are you going? <EOS>
<BOS> That's too early for me. <EOS>
<BOS> I met a recruiter at an event and she thinks I asked her out on a date. <EOS>
<BOS> I asked for her phone number and if she was available for lunch.   <EOS>
<BOS> That is my favorite shirt.   <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Do you think the dry cleaners can get it out? <EOS>
<BOS> I can't go back to school at this age. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't remember anything. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going to get a pet? <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of dog did you get? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow!  Puppies are a lot of work. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of supplies do you need? <EOS>
<BOS> We're not allowed to make personal calls at work. <EOS>
<BOS> You've been on the phone for over an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I'm sad too. But it's just too big for your mother and me. <EOS>
<BOS> Me too. This is the first home your mother and I bought. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course I remember them. Those were the best times. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish we didn't have to sell it, but we can no longer take care of it. We're getting old and it's too much work. <EOS>
<BOS> A young couple with two kids. They seem like a loving family. <EOS>
<BOS> We found a beautiful, small condo a few blocks away. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes. We have an extra room for guests, so your kids can stay over any time. <EOS>
<BOS> She's at the fabric store. She wants to sew new curtains for the condo. <EOS>
<BOS> When did Ann leave?  She was a great hair stylist. <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anyone else you recommend? <EOS>
<BOS> OK.  I will try her.   <EOS>
<BOS> I will take it. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice! I love the color. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you like it? <EOS>
<BOS> What is your favorite feature? <EOS>
<BOS> Did you get a good deal? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to buy a new car soon. Do you think your cousin could help me too? <EOS>
<BOS> Where does he work? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to save a little more money first. It's a big purchase. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, it's expensive to eat out all the time. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to make more money. I'm saving up for something. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a secret. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! I can do that. <EOS>
<BOS> Got it! <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I need a lot more to do. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you promise not to say anything? <EOS>
<BOS> I want to buy Dad a new watch for his birthday. <EOS>
<BOS> I only have a couple of weeks to save until his birthday. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice. What's her name? <EOS>
<BOS> Is she new to your school? <EOS>
<BOS> You have an aunt who lives in Seattle. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California. <EOS>
<BOS> You should invite her over for dinner one night. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. We can order pizza. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Let's invite her parents too. We can get to know them. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  Where should we go? <EOS>
<BOS> The Italian place? <EOS>
<BOS> Our clothes are popular, so let's make shoes too. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  I know a shoe designer who wants to work with us. <EOS>
<BOS> Hi Karen. No, I'm having lunch with my mom. It's her birthday today. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm free tomorrow. Where should we go? <EOS>
<BOS> I love Chinese food! Let's check it out. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that might be a good idea. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. How about Cathy and Lisa? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. What time should we meet tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> Hopefully, then can meet at noon too. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm sorry.  I just need to pay some bills. <EOS>
<BOS> I promise to pay you back soon. <EOS>
<BOS> It's boring and I have no one to talk to. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but they are all younger than me. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Where is it going to be? <EOS>
<BOS> I know. How long is it going to be? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I leave early? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I knew how to drive. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm going to go introduce myself. <EOS>
<BOS> That's why I'm going to introduce myself. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to be a manager one day.  This is one way to move up the ladder. <EOS>
<BOS> Why don't you come with me? <EOS>
<BOS> That's wonderful. Is it a special occasion? <EOS>
<BOS> Happy Anniversary! How many years have you been married? <EOS>
<BOS> That's wonderful. <EOS>
<BOS> That's so sweet. When do you leave? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you and Stan free tonight? <EOS>
<BOS> Would you like to come over? I'd like to make you both dinner since I missed your anniversary yesterday. <EOS>
<BOS> Come around 7 pm. Bob will be home by then. <EOS>
<BOS> How about some sun after you get back from the Bahamas? It's so cold here these days. <EOS>
<BOS> What's the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do if you can't reach a deal? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know yet. <EOS>
<BOS> No, the police are looking for them. <EOS>
<BOS> They are willing to offer $10,000 less than the asking price. <EOS>
<BOS> My clients are very nice people with two small kids.  <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, what a great opportunity for her. <EOS>
<BOS> I think that's wonderful idea. She is such a good co-worker. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Let's make it a potluck, so everyone can bring a dish to share. <EOS>
<BOS> Right! How many people do you want to invite? <EOS>
<BOS> I think there are about 30 people in our department, including us. <EOS>
<BOS> She doesn't like people making a big fuss over her, so let's keep it a secret. <EOS>
<BOS> When is she moving? <EOS>
<BOS> Then we should do it soon. She'll be busy packing and getting ready for the move. <EOS>
<BOS> Perfect! <EOS>
<BOS> She says it's too old.  All of her friends have smart phones now. <EOS>
<BOS> She wants to do social media and check emails. <EOS>
<BOS> I guess not.   <EOS>
<BOS> I think times are changing and she needs to keep up with her generation. <EOS>
<BOS> The boss approved your rental car? <EOS>
<BOS> He didn't approve a rental car during my business trip. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, you never clean up your mess.   <EOS>
<BOS> You need to do your share of the housework. <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice! You know how to build things with wood? <EOS>
<BOS> So, you're going to make a coffee table instead of buying one? <EOS>
<BOS> You're lucky you know how to build things. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, could you make me something if I pay you? <EOS>
<BOS> Carol has been asking for a new desk. Can you build a desk? <EOS>
<BOS> How much would you charge me? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok! I'll ask Carol to find a picture. <EOS>
<BOS> I've only been here for nine months, but I would like to take one week off next month. <EOS>
<BOS> No, my parents live in Italy and it's their 50th wedding anniversary.  <EOS>
<BOS> Could you take me to the store? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah.  It's in the shop for repairs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I need a new car. <EOS>
<BOS> How about the bank? <EOS>
<BOS> She seems very ambitious. <EOS>
<BOS> The boss is thinking about hiring her for a permanent position. <EOS>
<BOS> She gets along with everyone too. <EOS>
<BOS> I heard she wants to be the office manager. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you have time for lunch? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you having any luck? <EOS>
<BOS> How are you negotiating? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right.  We do. <EOS>
<BOS> Carol has put me on a strict diet. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  She says we need to live healthy at our age. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but I miss my meat and potatoes. <EOS>
<BOS> A salad. <EOS>
<BOS> That's it!  I had a small salad.  I'm starving. <EOS>
<BOS> I ordered red roses for my wife, but she received daisies.   <EOS>
<BOS> It is our anniversary and roses are her favorite flowers. <EOS>
<BOS> What should I do with the daisies?  <EOS>
<BOS> That's very nice of you. <EOS>
<BOS> I asked him a simple question. <EOS>
<BOS> He answered so rudely for no reason. <EOS>
<BOS> I asked him how he was doing this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> He's not a morning, afternoon, or night person. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to go to the mall. I broke my phone. <EOS>
<BOS> I dropped it outside on the concrete ground. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope it can be fixed or I have to buy a new one. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. If they can't fix it, maybe you can help me pick out a new phone. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't think I will have time. I have to pick up my children from school at 3 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Tomorrow is better. Where do you want to go? <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks! That's so nice of you. <EOS>
<BOS> They are extra things the company gives you besides your salary and basic benefits. <EOS>
<BOS> I like the paid vacation time and pension plan. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you going on maternity leave? <EOS>
<BOS> How long will you be gone? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm here for a procedure. <EOS>
<BOS> A root canal. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected. <EOS>
<BOS> A little. I took some medicine this morning. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I didn't think it was important. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth. <EOS>
<BOS> I love the smell of paper and the feel of a paperback book. <EOS>
<BOS> No, they're not.  What if you run out of batteries? <EOS>
<BOS> That's always your excuse. <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should leave earlier. <EOS>
<BOS> You are always sorry.   <EOS>
<BOS> What is your excuse this time? <EOS>
<BOS> We are meeting for lunch not breakfast. <EOS>
<BOS> Were you studying for a test? <EOS>
<BOS> You have terrible excuses for being late. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll check the flashlights and batteries. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm glad we have a basement. <EOS>
<BOS> Bring extra blankets and a first aid kit too. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't forget the dogs! <EOS>
<BOS> Really? You think so? <EOS>
<BOS> That's the position I was going to ask for, but I was worried. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a college degree. You have to have a college degree for that position. <EOS>
<BOS> I know, but degrees are important too. <EOS>
<BOS> I have, but I am so busy these days. I don't have time to work and study. <EOS>
<BOS> That's true. I'm not married yet, but I take care of my elderly parents. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. Well, thanks for your support. I'll let you know what happens. <EOS>
<BOS> Is it a special occasion? <EOS>
<BOS> I know that tomorrow is July 4, but what is so important about it? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean Independence Day? <EOS>
<BOS> How did America declare independence? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! I didn't know that. <EOS>
<BOS> How do you celebrate? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, those loud and colorful explosions in the sky? <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. Can I bring my children, too? <EOS>
<BOS> I would like to know why you leave your dog poop on my lawn. <EOS>
<BOS> I secretly video recorded my yard.   <EOS>
<BOS> I brought your dog poop in a bag.   I will leave it here. <EOS>
<BOS> Please don't do it anymore. <EOS>
<BOS> Your resume is very impressive.   <EOS>
<BOS> Would you be available to meet with me next week? <EOS>
<BOS> I would also like you to meet with our Vice-president. <EOS>
<BOS> I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.  What about Wednesday at noon? <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I knew how to play an instrument. <EOS>
<BOS> No. My mom gave me piano lessons when I was a child, but I hated it. So, I quit. <EOS>
<BOS> How long did you take lessons? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! You must be really good. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? <EOS>
<BOS> You come from a very talented family. <EOS>
<BOS> Guitar. <EOS>
<BOS> We can take lessons together. <EOS>
<BOS> The firefighters say there is nothing they can do at this point. They have to evacuate immediately. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I wish I could help them, but we live in another state. <EOS>
<BOS> They're going to stay with my sister until they find another place to live. <EOS>
<BOS> That might be a good idea. Maybe being away from there will help them forget about all of this. <EOS>
<BOS> Bob, I'm so sad. That was my childhood home. I have so many memories of that place. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. My sister too. She and I grew up in that house. My parents lived there for forty years. <EOS>
<BOS> They're going to lose everything. The firefighters gave them only a few hours to pack. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, my sister is with them. She's going to call me later tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what I just read. <EOS>
<BOS> From a drug overdose. <EOS>
<BOS> Just wait. <EOS>
<BOS> On social media. <EOS>
<BOS> I want another SUV. <EOS>
<BOS> I feel safer in a SUV. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a tight deadline. <EOS>
<BOS> Do you need help with the project? <EOS>
<BOS> That's interesting.  I'm in construction. <EOS>
<BOS> We're looking for an architect for our firm. <EOS>
<BOS> Can I have your business card?  Here is mine. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, that would be great.  My email address is on the card. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll be careful. <EOS>
<BOS> Why?  What's the problem? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  I won't get one.  I'll find something else to do. <EOS>
<BOS> I only heard from one person and he said they weren't hiring at this time. <EOS>
<BOS> They all promised to review my resume and help me find a job. <EOS>
<BOS> What's wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> So, you're on the no-sugar diet? <EOS>
<BOS> I tried that once.  It was hard. <EOS>
<BOS> I did the no-fat diet and exercise. <EOS>
<BOS> You can't eat things like fried foods, butter, or ice cream. <EOS>
<BOS> It is worse.  But, it works. <EOS>
<BOS> Someone keeps leaving their dog's poop on my lawn. <EOS>
<BOS> I am going to video record my yard and find out who the person is. <EOS>
<BOS> My apartment elevator isn't working. <EOS>
<BOS> Two weeks. <EOS>
<BOS> Can we afford to buy a new one? <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure! That sounds like fun. I need to ask my parents first. <EOS>
<BOS> Where are we going to stay? <EOS>
<BOS> That's nice! How many people are going? <EOS>
<BOS> Are your parents going to be there? <EOS>
<BOS> What should I bring? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't have a surfboard. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I've done it a few times. <EOS>
<BOS> Again? What's wrong with it this time? <EOS>
<BOS> That's weird. It's not even an old car. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't know? What is he doing then? <EOS>
<BOS> You should take it to another mechanic. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't sound very trustworthy. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe too cheap isn't always better. <EOS>
<BOS> You should demand a refund. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is it complicated? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I've been practicing every day. <EOS>
<BOS> I have to make a model of the White House. <EOS>
<BOS> We should go shopping for some supplies. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like e-books.   <EOS>
<BOS> They're not real pages.  Paperback books have pages you can turn. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a good point.  But, I still like paperback books better. <EOS>
<BOS> The boss?  Is something wrong? <EOS>
<BOS> Good luck! <EOS>
<BOS> The stock market crashed. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes.  I lost all my money. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok.  You look like you're in a hurry. <EOS>
<BOS> Paid vacations would make employees work better. <EOS>
<BOS> This company is never going to grow if we don't take care of our employees. <EOS>
<BOS> I think so. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. She's only 9 years old. <EOS>
<BOS> Tell her that babies cannot eat candy. <EOS>
<BOS> What if she changes her mind after Halloween is over? It's only once a year. <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe Janice can talk to her. <EOS>
<BOS> Just around our neighborhood. There are a lot of homes around here. <EOS>
<BOS> Bring Cindy here on Halloween. We can all go together. <EOS>
<BOS> I'm thinking about throwing Bobby a birthday party in the backyard. <EOS>
<BOS> The weather is going to be sunny this weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to do a barbeque and have games. <EOS>
<BOS> That would be wonderful. <EOS>
<BOS> I want to do something simple like grill hot dogs with potato chips. <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That is so kind of you. Are you sure? <EOS>
<BOS> Can I pay you? <EOS>
<BOS> Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Baking the birthday cake is plenty. <EOS>
<BOS> I am very impressed. <EOS>
<BOS> Please ask me. <EOS>
<BOS> I hope I don't say anything stupid. <EOS>
<BOS> When I'm nervous, I say silly things. <EOS>
<BOS> It's a video conference call.  She will be able to see me. <EOS>
<BOS> What about Fridays? <EOS>
<BOS> What does casual dress mean? <EOS>
<BOS> Last weekend. <EOS>
<BOS> It was very crowded. Parking is terrible too. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh yes! The roller coasters are really fun. My kids had a great time. It was even fun for the adults too. <EOS>
<BOS> You should. They will love it. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, they're pretty expensive. But your family will enjoy it. <EOS>
<BOS> If you go on Saturday, try to go early. There aren't enough parking spots. They need to add more. <EOS>
<BOS> The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient. <EOS>
<BOS> He doesn't like amusement parks? <EOS>
<BOS> Tell him to be prepared. There are a lot of roller coasters. <EOS>
<BOS> Her birthday is today.  My family and I are going to take her out to dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> 6 PM. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't get off work until 5 <EOS>
<BOS> That's a great idea!  I'll go there on my break. <EOS>
<BOS> Flowers and a card. <EOS>
<BOS> It's too expensive. <EOS>
<BOS> I don't know. I don't think many people are going. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. I remember when he yelled at me for being 10 minutes late to a presentation. <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah. I was pretty angry. <EOS>
<BOS> Why is the company throwing him a retirement party? <EOS>
<BOS> She must be crazy. <EOS>
<BOS> That's funny. Then we should all go. <EOS>
<BOS> That's a sad way to retire. <EOS>
<BOS> To retire with no one liking you. <EOS>
<BOS> Your favorite team. <EOS>
<BOS> Watch the highlights on the sports news. <EOS>
<BOS> Why? <EOS>
<BOS> What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there any way you can finish everything before your trip? <EOS>
<BOS> Is there anyone at work who can help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Oh. That's terrible. Why don't you talk to your boss? <EOS>
<BOS> Maybe you can take work with you on your trip. <EOS>
<BOS> I wish I could help you. <EOS>
<BOS> No, I'm an accountant. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  I don't trust her. <EOS>
<BOS> I think she wants my job. <EOS>
<BOS> How about this Friday evening? <EOS>
<BOS> What about Saturday night? <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to order? <EOS>
<BOS> I think I am going to order a turkey sandwich.   <EOS>
<BOS> What did you argue about? <EOS>
<BOS> What happened after you told her that? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, that could be a problem. <EOS>
<BOS> I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too. <EOS>
<BOS> What are you going to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Yes, I do. <EOS>
<BOS> Where is your car? <EOS>
<BOS> Are you ok? <EOS>
<BOS> That's good. When do you get your car back? <EOS>
<BOS> That's quick. <EOS>
<BOS> Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced? <EOS>
<BOS> I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work. <EOS>
<BOS> Really? That's good to know. <EOS>
<BOS> Thanks. I'll check it out tonight. <EOS>
<BOS> That's great. Where? <EOS>
<BOS> But why do you look so nervous? <EOS>
<BOS> Tell them that. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry so much. You're smart and you get along well with everyone. <EOS>
<BOS> Just answer them the best you can. Be confident. <EOS>
<BOS> What time is your interview? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, don't be late. That would be a bad first impression. <EOS>
<BOS> Good. Now go! <EOS>
<BOS> Can you pick our client up from the airport? <EOS>
<BOS> I need to check the email for the flight schedule. <EOS>
<BOS> No. Why? <EOS>
<BOS> It depends. What's the matter? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you tried to restart it? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you think it was infected by a virus? <EOS>
<BOS> I think you should have a professional take a look at it. <EOS>
<BOS> How old is it? <EOS>
<BOS> Ten years. I think that's the problem. <EOS>
<BOS> We just bought a new one. It works great. Do you want to come over and take a look? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you want to go to the basketball game? <EOS>
<BOS> 7 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Don't worry about it. It's my treat. <EOS>
<BOS> I'll pick you up at 6 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. I don't mind driving. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. Sounds good. Where should we go? <EOS>
<BOS> Steak? Sure! I'll pick you up at 4 pm. <EOS>
<BOS> Hey, thanks for dinner. <EOS>
<BOS> I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic. <EOS>
<BOS> Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close? <EOS>
<BOS> What time do you usually get there? <EOS>
<BOS> What happens if you're late? <EOS>
<BOS> Have you ever been late? <EOS>
<BOS> Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Is your boss understanding? <EOS>
<BOS> What time? <EOS>
<BOS> What about next Friday? <EOS>
<BOS> Why are you babysitting so much? <EOS>
<BOS> Do you like children? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't like them. They're noisy and they smell weird. <EOS>
<BOS> You're right. I'd rather babysit dogs. <EOS>
<BOS> I know. But they're cuter than kids. <EOS>
<BOS> Then when are you free for dinner? <EOS>
<BOS> OK. I'm free tomorrow too. I'll pick you up at 6 pm at your house. <EOS>
<BOS> What should I pack? <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  What else? <EOS>
<BOS> I don't own a suit. <EOS>
<BOS> Sure. What kind of snacks? <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. I will pick up some fruits too. <EOS>
<BOS> Fruits are healthy for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Are you done with your homework? <EOS>
<BOS> Then you should stay home and study. <EOS>
<BOS> Ok. We will only be gone for about an hour. <EOS>
<BOS> I thought you needed to study. <EOS>
<BOS> Our electric bill just came.  It's so high. <EOS>
<BOS> It is double the normal amount. <EOS>
<BOS> No.  We need to turn off the A/C right away. <EOS>
<BOS> I know.  Let's turn it on when the temperature is higher than 90 degrees. <EOS>
<BOS> They're getting a divorce. <EOS>
<BOS> Dan cheated on Molly. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you have to do? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! That's a lot of stuff to do. Why don't you do some of that tomorrow? <EOS>
<BOS> I completely understand. <EOS>
<BOS> I know what you mean. My mom is very clean and organized too. <EOS>
<BOS> Why doesn't your husband help you? <EOS>
<BOS> Wow! He did a lot too. <EOS>
<BOS> What a busy day! Do you need any help? <EOS>
<BOS> I'm not busy today. I can help you. <EOS>
<BOS> Of course! You can pay me back when I drop off the groceries. <EOS>
<BOS> That's what friends and neighbors are for. <EOS>
<BOS> My printer isn't working. <EOS>
<BOS> I already tried that two times. <EOS>
<BOS> What kind of plans? <EOS>
<BOS> What is your goal? <EOS>
<BOS> My plan is to work for you. <EOS>
<BOS> Not well.  I heard he is very tough. <EOS>
<BOS> Yes!  I'm not good at negotiating. <EOS>
<BOS> What do you mean? <EOS>
<BOS> That's great advice. <EOS>
